Despite having to pay more than other banking options, much of the appeal of credit cards are the lavish rewards and benefits that come with them. From up to 100% back on travel expenses offered by Discovery Bank, to 24/7 personal financial assistance with Nedbank, local banks are catering to high-income people with special lifestyle and business needs. The cards themselves have become statements of status; many follow the same design layout of being all black and minimalistic, but some banks differentiate themselves, notably Discovery with its bright purple vertical card. BusinessTech looked at some of the most exclusive bank cards available in South Africa: Discovery Bank Purple Wealth Suite <img class="wp-image-565042 size-full aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shutterstockdiscovery_418545580.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shutterstockdiscovery_418545580.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shutterstockdiscovery_418545580-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Discovery Bank offers two different banking products, the Discovery Bank Purple Suite for South Africa’s wealthy and the Discovery Bank Purple Wealth Suite for the super-rich. The qualifications to be considered for an invitation are unknown; however, the standard Discovery Bank Purple Suite requirements are still high. A prospective cardholder must earn no less than R2.5 million, the equivalent of a monthly salary of R208,000. According to Discovery, the Wealth Suite offers its cardholders a metal credit card that can reward cardholders with up to 100% off on local and international business class flights for themselves and a spouse. Other rewards include luxury accommodation through the Purple Hotel Collection, unlimited airport lounge visits, a more personalised banking experience, better rates on investments, and free gym memberships at any Virgin Active or Planet Fitness health club in South Africa.

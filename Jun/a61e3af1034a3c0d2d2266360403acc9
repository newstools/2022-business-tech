Standard Bank has asked some of its customers to re-register for Apple Pay services as it makes changes to its backend as part of an ongoing maintenance programme. In a letter sent to clients, and seen by BusinessTech, the bank said the maintenance is scheduled for mid-June. “We hope that you are enjoying Apple Pay and the security it provides that allows you to safely make purchases,” the statement reads. “To continue to offer you this convenient payment option, we will be undertaking maintenance of the enrolment process on the Standard Bank Apple Pay platform from 13 to 14 June 2022. As a result of the maintenance work being carried out, you will need to re-register your card to Apple Pay using the Standard Bank App. “We ask you do this so that you can continue to use Apple Pay without disruptions. Your profile will therefore be made inactive so that you can go ahead with this re-registration. Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience you may experience as a result.” To reactivate your profile, Standard Bank said you will need to re-register your card to Apple Pay via the Standard Bank App by following the steps below: Open our Banking App and tap ‘Manage’;
Tap ‘Cards’ and select the card you wish to link to Apple Pay;
Tap ‘Add to Apple Wallet’ and accept the Terms and Conditions;
Follow the instructions to link your card. The bank noted that clients will only be able to reregister their cards from 14 June 2022. Read: TymeBank is adding 130,000 people a month in South Africa – but there’s a hitch

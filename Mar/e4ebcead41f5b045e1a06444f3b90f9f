Historically, statistical reports on residential property price appreciation and market activity tend to focus on the major metros and hubs in South Africa. However, new data from Pam Golding Property shows that young buyers are purchasing properties in unconventional towns for their medium to long-term capital growth perspectives, lifestyle and value for money. Chief executive of Pam Golding Property, Dr Andrew Golding, said the city of George for example with its own airport and amenities like good schools attracts business people wanting to relocate, migrators and retirees all seeking a gentler way of life. “According to Lightstone statistics, recent buyers (February 2021 to January 2022) in George are widely distributed across all groups; however, 43% of recent buyers fall into the 36-49 age category, and a further 16% young adults (18-35),” said Golding. Stephen Murray, Pam Golding Properties area principal in George, said that many of the home buyers are from Gauteng and Western Cape and that they believe the reasoning for wanting to move to the Garden Route remains that they are purchasing for primary residential use. “Price growth can tend to slow demand, but generally, it’s a result of limited stock availability, which has meant that prices have been steady in their upward trend.” Kraaibosch Park, George, R2.875 million: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563386" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kraaibosch-Park-R2.875m-e1646052045983.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="806" /> Statistics from research and data specialists Lightstone indicate strong and steady growth in George’s freehold residential property prices over the past decade, with a surge in activity in 2021, particularly vacant plots in estates, said Murray. Pam Golding reported that vacant land in estates is usually in the price range from R1 million upwards. At the same time, sectional title apartments start at R1.1 million and R2 million for freehold properties. “As a property class, I also anticipate that in the not-too-distant future popular new developments may take the form of sectional title apartments as affordability becomes more important. Traditionally, George has not been a sectional title town, with 95.2% of homes comprising freehold, with 14.9% of these in estates.” Here are some places that young homebuyers are moving to:

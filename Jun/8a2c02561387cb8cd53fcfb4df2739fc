While the government has announced plans for no fewer than three new smart cities across South Africa, real estate group Attacq is steadily building a new one in the heart of Johannesburg. In a presentation to shareholders on Tuesday (7 June), the group said its ultimate goal is to turn the Waterfall development into a smart, safe, sustainable city through private partnerships. This will include a revamped logistics programme, new residential developments, and further client-led developments which are expected to see more businesses move into the area. Several major companies have opened offices in the city in recent years, including professional services firm PwC and clothing retailer Cotton On. The new Vantage data centre is also currently under construction. Among other features, the development also boasts its own distribution and logistics hubs, a 1.2-hectare park, four schools, and is within walking distance of the Mall of Africa and private hospital facilities. It is now also home to several residential developments – including an equestrian estate, a country estate, apartment buildings and a hotel. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-594364 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Waterfall-2-1024x565.png" alt="" width="840" height="463" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Waterfall-2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Waterfall-2-300x165.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Waterfall-2-768x424.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Waterfall-2-1200x662.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Waterfall-2.png 1398w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Waterfall Access Networks (WAN) implements and manages the open-access fibre optic network for Waterfall.  The group noted that there is currently more than 714km of installed duct infrastructure on the development and the network is fully redundant. In addition, there are 33 cell masts on Waterfall, guaranteeing reception. The city also has its own ‘GO Waterfall’ app, developed specifically for those living and working in Waterfall. Waterfall Corporate Campus Waterfall Corporate Campus is a 50/50 joint venture with Zenprop Property and its subsidiaries. The final development will include seven office buildings and a centrally located communal facility that includes a conference facility and restaurant. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-435175

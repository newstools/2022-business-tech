Eskom has announced stage 4 load shedding will be implemented on Sunday afternoon, with varying stages of load shedding implemented during the week. “Due to the loss of five large generation units over the past 36 hours, as well as the delay in returning five units to service, load shedding will regrettably be increased to stage 3 (previously communicated as stage 2) at 07h00 -16h00 tomorrow. “Between 16h00 and 00h00 load shedding will be implemented at stage 4, and then reduced to stage 2 until 05h00 on Monday.” Three units at Kendal, one each at Tutuka and Majuba power stations were forced offline to perform emergency repairs, while the return to service of a unit each at the Medupi, Arnot, Camden, Kriel and Duvha power stations has been delayed. “Regrettably, Stage 4 load shedding will have to be implemented at 05h00 – 00h00 on Monday. Load shedding will then be reduced to Stage 2 from midnight until 05h00 on Tuesday. This load shedding sequence is likely to be repeated throughout the week.” Eskom said it currently has 4,597MW on planned maintenance, while another 16,457MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “As the generation capacity shortages persist over the next few weeks, load shedding will continue to be implemented at various stages. Eskom cautions the public that it will still take a few weeks for the power generation system to recover. “Eskom would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We, therefore, urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially during these uncertain times on the power system.” <img class="size-full wp-image-604880 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding.png" alt="" width="645" height="343" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding.png 645w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

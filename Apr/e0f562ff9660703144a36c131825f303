The new vehicle market’s performance continued to exceed expectations during the month of March, says the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa. The aggregate domestic new vehicle sales in March 2022, at 50,607 units, represented the highest total monthly sales since pre-pandemic October 2019 sales. Toyota as a manufacturer sold the most vehicles locally in March with 15,008 units, significantly higher than Volkswagen Group SA in second with 6,433 units, followed by Hyundai Automotive with 3,816 units. A temporary reduction in the general fuel levy by R1.50 per litre from 6 April to 31 May 2022, announced by finance minister Godongwana has provided relief for motorists and has been welcomed by the market, said Naamsa. This is how the petrol price has changed and is expected to be reflected: Below are the top-selling new vehicles in the country right now and how much it costs to drive them: Toyota Hilux 2.7 Double Cab S – From R479,200 10.7L/100km

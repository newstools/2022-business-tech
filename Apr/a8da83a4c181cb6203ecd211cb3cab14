Professional networking platform LinkedIn has published its sixth annual top companies list, detailing the best companies to work for in South Africa and the skills which are most likely to help you land a job. “As professionals worldwide moved jobs at unprecedented rates in 2021, companies have had to step up to attract and retain talent – from offering more opportunities for promotion and gaining new skills to increasing flexibility,” the hitting website said. “This was also the case in South Africa, where one survey found that staff turnover had increased by 16% across all sectors last year, and that nearly a third of survey participants indicated they struggled to attract new or retain their existing talent. The many changes have put employees and job seekers in the driver’s seat, igniting them to rethink what they expect out of an employer today.” The top companies were selected based on a combination of research and unique member data, with LinkedIn focusing on workplaces where professionals can ‘grow their careers’, and which make the biggest impact in the professional world. To be eligible, companies must have at least 500 employees as of 31 December 2021, and employee attrition can be no higher than 10% over the prior 12 months. BusinessTech looked at the list of top companies and the skills and jobs which feature most prominently in their hiring posts. LinkedIn has also collated a list of some of the open jobs at each company. Information and job openings were correct at the time of publication.

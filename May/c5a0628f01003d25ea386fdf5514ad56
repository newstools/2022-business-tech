The Gautrain Management Agency has published its updated fees which will take effect from 1 June 2022. As in previous years, the service has separate peak and off-peak fares – depending on the days and times that you travel. However, high peak fares (red fares) have been suspended for a trial period, with the possibility of these fares being reintroduced at a later date. In 2022 the most expensive one-way ticket is from Pretoria/Hatfield to OR Tambo and will cost R217. This includes a new minimum requirement of R32 on your Gautrain card to use the service. The maximum Pay-As-You-Go value that can be loaded onto a Gautrain Card is R3,200. You can find the full 2022 price schedule below: Peak fares:  indicated in orange are applied when you access the Gautrain between 06h00 and 08h30, between 16h00 and 18h30 on weekdays and all day on weekends and public holidays.

The first phase of the project, which launched in May 2010 only contained four stations – OR Tambo, Rhodesfield, Marlboro and Sandton. A second phase – completed in 2011 – connected Sandton to Park Station, and Midrand to Hatfield in Tshwane. Upon becoming fully operational in 2011, it cost R105 to travel one way to the OR Tambo International Airport from Sandton, R125 from Pretoria, and R115 from Johannesburg Park Station. These fees were much cheaper when buying a monthly or weekly ticket. A monthly ticket from Hatfield to Park Station cost R39 per trip, while a single trip on a weekly ticket between Park Station and Hatfield cost R43. Commuters could pay R10 a day to park at stations if they were using the Gautrain and R80 a day if they were not. The cost of the required contactless card was R10.

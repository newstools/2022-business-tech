The South African Police Service (SAPS) has presented the country’s latest crime statistics, covering the third quarter of the 2021/22 financial year, October to December 2021. Total reported crimes over the period declined by 3.3%, both as a result of reported crimes, as well as a reduction in the number of crimes detected through police activity. Contact crimes, which include categories like assault and sexual offences, were down overall, but violent crimes like murder and attempted murder are up. South Africa recorded 6,859 murders in the three-month period, up from 6,279 the year before (+9.2%). Attempted murders were up 3.5%, with the SAPS tracking 5,645 cases. Contact-related crimes and other serious crimes were both up in the quarter, with a notable increase in carjackings (+13.8%) and commercial crimes (+15.9%). On a more positive front, property crimes were down, with big drops in common robbery (-11.0%), theft out of vehicles (-11.1%) and shoplifting (-15.1%). Crime detected as a result of police action was down. This category of crime reporting is difficult to describe as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, as reduced numbers may reflect fewer instances of crime (a positive trend) or a lack of policing (a negative trend). Provincially, Gauteng reported the most number of crimes, with 107,815 cases opened by the community. This is followed by the Western Cape with 72,547 cases, and KwaZulu-Natal with 61,605 cases. In previous quarterly reports, the SAPS compared the 2021/22 stats to those in 2019, saying that the 2020/21 period was not comparable because of the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. For the third quarter stats, 2019 comparisons have been dropped and figures have returned to regular year-on-year analysis.

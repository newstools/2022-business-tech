It’s rewarding to get a quote on your car insurance with OUTsurance. That’s because either one of two things can happen: they could save you money on your car insurance each and every month, or you can ask them for R500 cash if they somehow can’t save you money. It’s a clear win-win! Click here to start an OUTsurance car insurance quote. OUTsurance asks you all the right questions about your car and driving habits, to find ways which could save you money. This includes calculating your premium according to your unique risk profile, so you’re not subsidising high-risk clients. If OUTsurance has done all they can to lower your car insurance premium, and they still are not cheaper than what you’re currently paying somewhere else, you can ask them for R500 cash. Better yet, if you’ve been claim-free and with the same insurer for three years, you can ask them to triple it to R1,500. It’s just that easy to get rewarded! Of course! It’s not only about saving you money or giving you a cash payout, it’s essentially about giving you a better deal on car insurance. Here’s how OUTsurance gives you even more out: Included OUTbonus: 10% of your paid premiums paid back in cash after three claim-free years.
Fixed excess per event, irrespective of the size or value of your claim.
Help@OUT emergency roadside assistance, available 24/7, 365 days of the year.
Hand-picked panel beaters: Come claims time, your vehicle will be repaired by one of OUTsurance approved service providers and your repairs are guaranteed for a 12-month period.
SmartDrive: Share your driving habits on the OUTsurance app and they’ll give you a discount of up to 10% on your monthly premiums.

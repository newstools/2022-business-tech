By delaying payment, customers also have the time to plan their payments in advance.” The retailer’s mink blankets in particular have developed a reputation for quality and luxury over the past 3 decades. The brushed fibres stay soft to the touch and carry a rich, velvet-like sheen. Many of them are reversible, featuring 2 trendy designs. They are available with up to 3 layers (2 mink layers with a thick filler layer in-between). As winter necessities, homechoice blankets never fail to keep the cold at bay with weights that range from 2kg, all the way to 7kg. Instead of marking up blanket prices to capitalise on demand, the retailer is currently offering customers 3 mink blankets for the price of 2 in selected homechoice blanket combos. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-585670" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/homechoice-businesstech-body-blanket-3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/homechoice-businesstech-body-blanket-3.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/homechoice-businesstech-body-blanket-3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-585692" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/businesstech-homechoice-body-blanket-4.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/businesstech-homechoice-body-blanket-4.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/businesstech-homechoice-body-blanket-4-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-585666" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/homechoice-businesstech-body-blanket-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/homechoice-businesstech-body-blanket-2.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/homechoice-businesstech-body-blanket-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> These are available on affordable credit terms, even for those who don’t qualify for the ‘buy now, pay later’ offer. “We’re doing all we can to make sure our customers are ready for winter,” adds Steyn.

Every year on 6 April, the prices of most UK visas increase as the Home Office revises pricing, notes John Dunn, director of citizenship and immigration at Sable International. Immigration Health Surcharge “If you are moving to the UK for more than six months, you will also need to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS),” said Dunn. The IHS allows the use of the National Health Service (NHS) as soon as you arrive in the UK. “Paying this surcharge gives you access to free basic medical care while you are in the UK.” Below is a table that shows the fees charged by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI): Current conversion rate: £1/R19.23. How does the IHS work? The IHS is an upfront fee that is paid in full along with your visa application. The amount you’ll have to pay depends on which visa you are applying for and how long you’ll be staying in the UK, said Dunn. The current fee is R12,000/£624. If you’re applying for an Ancestry visa which is valid for five years, you’ll have to pay R60,000/£3,120 upfront as part of your application. The surcharges for other common visas are as follows: Spouse visa – R23,993
Spousal extension – R23,993
Youth Mobility Scheme – R18,071
Student visa – R9,035 Correct Application Every year, thousands of visa applications are rejected because they are filled out incorrectly or applicants haven’t included the right documents, said Dunn. “The Home Office will keep your visa fee whether your application gets accepted or denied, to avoid throwing money away, or paying the same amount twice, it’s important that your application is as watertight as possible.” Commentary provided by John Dunn, director of citizenship and immigration at Sable International.

Power utility Eskom will no longer implement stage 4 load shedding on Wednesday (13 July), saying it has enough capacity to keep rolling blackouts at stage 3. Additionally, the overnight load shedding at Stage 2 will be reduced to Stage 1 from midnights to 05h00 on Thursday, it said. Load shedding for Thursday, however, remains as previously communicated. Here is the new schedule: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-606252" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Wednesday-13-July.png" alt="" width="714" height="507" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Wednesday-13-July.png 944w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Wednesday-13-July-300x213.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Wednesday-13-July-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In its previous statements, Eskom warned that generation capacity shortages would persist for “the next few weeks” and that load shedding schedules would change as and when the available capacity changes. “As the generation capacity shortages persist over the next few weeks, load shedding will continue to be implemented at various stages. Eskom cautions the public that it will still take a few weeks for the power generation system to recover,” it said. “Eskom would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially during these uncertain times on the power system.”  Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

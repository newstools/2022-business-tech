Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has announced the new wages for municipal workers in South Africa, with employees set for a pay rise after a wage freeze in 2021. “The salary and allowances of a councillor are determined by that municipal council by resolution of a supporting vote of the majority of its members, in consultation with the member of the executive council responsible for local government in each province, having regard to the upper limits as set out hereunder, the financial year of a municipality and affordability of municipality to pay within the different grades of the remuneration of councillors, including the austerity measures as approved by the national cabinet,” the minister said. It is estimated that there are more than 9,000 councillors in South Africa’s 278 municipalities. However, the data below specifically pertains to top earners such as mayors, deputy mayors, speakers, mayoral committee members, executives of sub councils, and whips. Under the current system, municipal workers are paid based on a point system that factors into its municipal income and the population that falls under the municipality. <img class="size-full wp-image-534010 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-1.png" alt="" width="583" height="157" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-1.png 583w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-1-300x81.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 85vw, 583px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-534012 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-2.png" alt="" width="581" height="155" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-2.png 581w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-2-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 85vw, 581px" /> The sum of the number of points allocated to a municipal council in terms of the above table determines the grade of such municipal council as follows: <img class="size-full wp-image-534014 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-3.png" alt="" width="586" height="151" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-3.png 586w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Municipal-3-300x77.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 85vw, 586px" /> This table is then used to determine the pay of mayors and other top municipal workers including the deputy mayor, speakers, mayoral committee members, executives of sub-councils, and whips.

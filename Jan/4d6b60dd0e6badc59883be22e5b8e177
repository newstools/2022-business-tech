The Top Employers Institute Africa has published its list of the best companies to work for in South Africa in 2022, across every major business sector. The institute recognises companies for their outstanding HR strategies and people practices, with companies evaluated across a number of key areas including talent strategy, workforce planning, on-boarding, and development. The Top Employers Institute then evaluates the implementation of these practices and reviews how they are supported through strategy, ownership, practices, measurement and technology. It must also be noted that the Top Employers certification is done by application. In addition to an overall top 20 list, the Top Employers Institute has recognised industry leaders where there are three or more certified South African organisations in the same industry sector. In places where there are two or fewer certified South African organisations in an industry sector, the company must obtain a score that puts them in the overall top 20 positions. The following companies were ranked as the top companies to work for in their respective sectors. In 2021, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic continued to be a challenging and difficult time for societies across the globe. It demanded that companies worldwide continue to commit to meeting the changing needs of their employees and the wider world around them, said chief executive of Top Employers Institute David Plink. “Reflecting on the demanding year that has, like the year before it, impacted organisations across the world. We are happy to see those certified organisations in Africa have continued to prioritise maintaining excellent people practices in the workplace. “Despite the challenges, they continue to meet the challenges of the changing world of work while working tirelessly to make a positive impact on the lives of their workforce.” Read: New rules planned for foreign workers in South Africa

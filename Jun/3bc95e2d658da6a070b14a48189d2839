The South African Police Service (SAPS) has presented the country’s latest crime statistics, covering the fourth quarter of the 2021/22 financial year, January to March 2022. Total reported crimes during the period increased significantly, both as a result of reported crimes, and a jump in the number of crimes detected through police activity. Contact crimes, including assault and sexual offences, saw a jump of 15%, with violent crimes like murder, assault and sexual offences also recording double-digit growth. According to the SAPS, 6,083 people were murdered over the quarter (up 22%) – the equivalent of 68 people a day – which is the highest number recorded over this period in the last five years. Attempted murders were up 25%, with the SAPS tracking 5,717 cases. Across most violent crime categories, the stats for the quarter are the worst they have been for the same period over the last five years. Contact-related crimes and other serious crimes were both up in the quarter, with a notable increase in carjackings (+19.7%), truck hijacking (+31.4%), and assault (+18%). Notably, of the 23 community reported crimes tracked by the SAPS, only four saw a decline compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, 14 other crime categories saw numbers jump by more than 10%, year on year. On a more positive note, the stats also show increased police activity, with crimes detected as a result of police action also rising over the quarter. The number of cases of driving under the influence spiked by almost 40%, while drug-related crimes detected was up 18%. Provincially, Gauteng recorded 104,999 cases opened by the community. This is followed by the Western Cape with 72,448 cases, and KwaZulu-Natal with 60,108 cases. In previous quarterly reports, the SAPS compared the 2021/22 stats to those in 2019, saying that the 2020/21 period was not comparable because of the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Since the third quarter, 2019 comparisons have been dropped and figures have returned to regular year-on-year analysis.

The resurfacing of national road R33 section between Mkhondo and Amsterdam “The duration of these projects ranges from 10 to 15 months, and they are estimated to cost between R40 million to R50 million each. Opportunities for subcontracting in these projects include concrete pavement repair, drainage and structures improvements, road furniture (road signs, guardrails) and road markings,” the agency said. Sanral board chairperson Themba Mhambi said all of the group’s projects should have a direct impact on the communities in the form of jobs, community development and skills training for small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs). “Sanral is committed to ensuring that its transformation policy is understood and relevant to the communities in which its projects are operating and ensure that all SMMEs in the affected local municipality are afforded an equal opportunity to tender for projects in the area,” he said.

Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Petrol price intervention: Government is expected to step in to further intervene on the country’s petrol price after officials from the National Treasury and Department of Energy met this weekend. An announcement is expected to be made sometime this week, says finance minister Enoch Godongwana. [BusinessDay] R25/litre from this week: Economist Dawie Roodt has warned that without intervention, South Africans will be paying more than R25/litre for petrol this week – with the expected R4/litre the country’s biggest increase ever. Roodt said that one possible way to get around these record petrol prices going forward is to ‘deregulate’ the petrol price which would allow individual petrol stations to se their own price. [eNCA].

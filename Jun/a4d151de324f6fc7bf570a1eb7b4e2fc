The construction of the 24,000 sqm single-level Boardwalk Mall is 80% complete and forging ahead, says Paul Gerard, managing director of the Flanagan & Gerard Property Group. Boardwalk Mall in the Eastern Cape is a major development by Flanagan & Gerard Group and Emfuleni Resorts, a subsidiary of Sun International. The R500 million project is an extension and upgrade of the existing Boardwalk Precinct and is set to more than double the retail space in the area. The first phase of Boardwalk Mall opened on 24 March 2022 and the grand opening is on track for 22 September 2022, Gerard said. “The mall will introduce the first Checkers, Woolworths Food and Dis-Chem stores to the Summerstrand area while also providing all the convenience and choice of a Pick n Pay, and Clicks and the very latest cinema upgrade from NuMetro,” he said. Confirmed retailers include Sportscene, Totalsports, Ripcurl, Queenspark, Senqu, American Swiss, Exact, Refinery, Legit and Side Step.
Spur, Steers, Debonairs, Fishaways, Wimpy and a McDonald’s Drive-Thru will also form part of the development.
The banking line-up includes ABSA, Capitec, FNB and Nedbank. Gerard said the mall will also highlight local and independent retailers, including home-grown labels MaXhosa with their South African branded high-end fashion, BohoGirl and Obriani. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-601928 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-601930 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Hotel and events Boardwalk Mall links with the Sun International Boardwalk Casino and the five-star 140-room Boardwalk Hotel. It is right on the beachfront, and shoppers can step out onto the beautiful promenade running along the incredibly popular Blue Flag Hobie Beach. It is also near the MSC cruise ship dock in Port Elizabeth Harbour, making it a must-visit for tourists, Gerard said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-601932 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-4-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-4-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-4-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-4-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boardwalk-Mall-4-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> A new 2,500sqm events arena is also being built at the Boardwalk’s heart – the Sunpark Events Arena. “The Sunpark Events Arena will add to the lifestyle and entertainment activities on offer and provides an exceptional quality Eastern Cape venue for the legendary events that Sun International hosts around the country,” Gerard said. “The major investment that goes into a shopping centre like Boardwalk Mall has exponential and multi-layered benefits for its community. With so many everyday needs taken care of under one roof at Boardwalk Mall, and so many new and special attractions for locals and tourists alike, we’re excited to welcome everyone to a great place where our community comes first.” Read: One of South Africa’s biggest property groups is running out of diesel for generators during load shedding

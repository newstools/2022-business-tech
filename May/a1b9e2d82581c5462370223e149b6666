We are also not looking for a monthly PhD thesis which is too long and boring for anyone to care about. If this project was a sport, it would be T20 cricket. The fundamentals of the respected game are there, but people are watching to see how many sixes can be hit. Broad Media offers an excellent work environment, a competitive salary, and the room to learn and grow in your career. This position is full-time and based at Broad Media’s head office in Centurion. Broad Media is South Africa’s leading independent online media company, and is home to MyBroadband, BusinessTech, What’s Next, Business Talk, TopAuto, and MyBroadband Insights.

The Ford Ranger was South Africa’s best-selling bakkie in May 2022, raking in a total of 1,548 sales, reports TopAuto. Following the Ford was the Toyota Hilux with 1,368 vehicles sold, a noticeable dip from the 2,788 units that found new owners in April. However, the lower numbers are mainly a result of stock challenges as Toyota’s manufacturing plant in KwaZulu-Natal is currently out of commission due to damages caused by floods. As a result, the Hilux will be out of production for “quite some time” with the supply of locally-produced Toyota models expected to be extremely limited for the next few months, said the manufacturer. Despite these roadblocks, the Hilux still managed to outsell nearly every other bakkie in the country by a large margin. The Isuzu D-max was the third most sold bakkie with 1,631 units during the month of May followed by the single cab Nissan NP200 (1,066) and the Mahindra Pik Up (688). With regard to fuel consumption, the Ford Ranger was not only the top-selling but the most fuel-efficient bakkie on the provided list with only 6.5L/100km compared to the highest guzzler the Toyota Land Cruiser 79 with more than double at 13.6L/100km. All prices and statistics are based on the cheapest available double cab configuration with single cab versions such as the Nissan NP200 generally being more affordable: Ford Ranger – 1,548 units From R448,530

Due to a continued shortage of generation capacity, Eskom has announced stage 1 load shedding will be implemented at 17h00 until 22h00 on Saturday afternoon. Stage 1 load shedding will be repeated at the same time on Sunday afternoon, the power utility said. “While this is the case currently, Eskom cautions the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks. Eskom will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary. “We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items.” Eskom said it currently has 4,279MW in outages due to planned maintenance, while another 15,943MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “Eskom apologises for the implementation of load shedding and is working around the clock to return to service as many units as possible. We would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. “We, therefore, urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially between 05h00 – 09h00 in the mornings and 16h00 – 22h00 in the evenings.” Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

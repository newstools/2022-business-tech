Africrest Properties, a property company specialising in converting office buildings to apartments, has provided more details around its new flagship project – The Apollo. The Apollo will see the 30,000 square-metre ex-PwC building in Sunninghill turned into 700 apartments. Africrest said the development will sit in the build-to-rent asset class. “This is an asset class which until recently has been largely ignored in South Africa but as it has continued to perform extremely well through tumultuous times,” the property investment group said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-550206 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-1-1024x576.png" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-1-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-1-768x432.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-1-1536x863.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-1-2048x1151.png 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-1-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-550202 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-2-1024x576.png" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-2-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-2-768x432.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-2-1200x675.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-2.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-550204 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “The apartments are built to enhance your comfort with designs that maximize space and function. The state-of-the-art facilities are designed to make you feel like they’re an extension of your apartment,” Africrest said. It noted that its location in Sunninghill, means that tenants are only minutes away from major hotspots including Sandton, Waterfall, Midrand, Woodmead, Fourways and Bryanston.” Studio apartments at the Apollo will start at R5,490 a month, with one and two-bedroom apartments starting at R5,990 and R7,500 respectively. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-550216 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-4-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-4-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-550218 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-5-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-5-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-5-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-550220 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-6-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-6-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-6-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apollo-6-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Some of the key features of the development include: Free uncapped high-speed fibre

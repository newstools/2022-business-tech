Financial services company Discovery has been approved for a secondary listing on A2X Markets (A2X), and its shares will be available for trade on A2X from 4 July 2022. Discovery said it will retain its primary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and its issued share capital will be unaffected by its secondary listing on A2X. “Discovery is a shared value financial services company whose purpose and ambition are achieved through a pioneering business model that incentivises people to be healthier, and enhances and protects their lives. This unique approach has underpinned their success globally, with substantial new business growth and an impressive increase in normalised operating profit and headline earnings.” Discovery said its secondary listing on A2X will provide its investors with the benefit of an additional platform on which to trade the company’s shares, added liquidity, lower exchange fees and narrower spreads. The listing will bring the number of instruments available for trade on A2X to 69 with a combined market capitalisation of around R4.5 trillion. Discovery joins other JSE Top40 Index constituents, AngloGold Ashanti, Aspen, Exxaro, Growthpoint, Implats, Investec Ltd and Investec plc, Mr Price, Naspers, Nedbank, Nepi Rockcastle, Prosus, Remgro, Sanlam, Sasol and Standard Bank on the A2X exchange.

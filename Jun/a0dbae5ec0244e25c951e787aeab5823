Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele says that the government is committed to paying out the R350 Social Relief of Distress Grants to beneficiaries. This follows media reports that some grant beneficiaries had not received payments for up to three months. The Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant, introduced in May 2020, was due to come to an end in March 2022 but was extended in February this year to March 2023. But all those who got the grant have to re-apply in the new cycle. News24 reported that the 10.6 million people who applied to receive the new round of grants from 1 April have not yet received payments for April and May. The delay is due to the decision by the Department of Social Development to set a means test for the new phase of the grant, News24 said. The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) said it hoped to begin payments in mid-June. “This government will always fulfil whatever undertaking it has [with regards to the SRD]. If there was a period of non-payment… on behalf of this government, we will make that apology. But as long as those SRDs are due, in line with the president’s commitment, they will be paid,” Gungubele said. The minister briefed media on Thursday  (9 June) after Cabinet’s meeting. He called on South Africans to remain vigilant around the Covid-19 virus. “Cabinet reminds everyone that Covid-19 has not been eradicated and the risks of new infections will increase during the winter season. We must continue to take all the necessary precautions to safeguard ourselves and other people. This includes washing or sanitising hands regularly, wearing a mask when indoors, keeping a safe social distance, opening windows for ventilation and vaccinating,” Gungubele said.

Power utility Eskom says that stage 2 load shedding will continue over the weekend, taking place during the evening peak. Stage 2 load shedding will take place between 17h00 and 22h00 on Saturday and Sunday, in line with the group’s announcement last Saturday. Eskom has implemented load shedding during this peak time all week, at stage 4 on Monday, stage 3 on Tuesday, and stage 2 on Wednesday through to Friday. The load shedding is due to a shortage of generation capacity, where unplanned outages or breakdowns have resulted in as much as 17,500MW being taken offline. On Friday, reported breakdowns had recovered to 15,534MW. However, Eskom’s emergency reserves are under pressure because of increased dependence. Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer said the utility was burning two million litres of diesel per day to make up for generation losses. The national grid is under major strain due to the colder weather and demand on the system during peak hours. Consumers are encouraged to reduce demand by turning off non-essential appliances and reduce usage during peak hours – 05h00 to 09h00 in the mornings, and 16h00 to 22h00 in the evenings.

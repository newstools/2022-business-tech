Eskom has announced that it will move to stage 2 load shedding for the rest of the week. The power utility said stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 17h00 this afternoon and continue until 05h00 on Monday (9 May). “This load shedding has been caused by a shortage of generation capacity owing to delays in returning generators to service, as well as breakdowns of nine generators. Eskom will continue to monitor the system and implement any changes as required. “Since yesterday a generation unit each at Lethabo, Tutuka, Ingula, Drakensberg, Arnot as well as two units each at Hendrina and Matla power stations suffered breakdowns. Further, delays in returning generators to service at Arnot, Kendal and three units at Tutuka power stations have added to the capacity constraints. Eskom said it expects to return as many of these units to service as possible over the next few days. It also expects to rely on the use of emergency generating reserves to limit the stage of load shedding during this period. “We currently have 3,875MW on planned maintenance, while another 15,067MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. Eskom would again like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We, therefore, request the public to continue using electricity sparingly to reduce the occurrence of load shedding. “Eskom will promptly inform the public should there be any further significant developments.” Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

Eskom has confirmed that stage 6 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00 until 22h00 on Wednesday evening, with power outages set to continue for the rest of the week. The new schedule is as follows: Wednesday (29 June) Stage 6 from 16h00 to 22h00
Stage 4 from 22h00 to 00h00 Thursday (30 June) Stage 2 from 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 4 from 05h00 to 00h00 Friday (1 July) Stage 2 from 00h00 to 05h00 “While some workers have started reporting for duty at the power stations, there is still a high level of absenteeism. As a result of the unlawful strike, routine maintenance work has had to be postponed. This backlog will take days to weeks to clear. It is therefore important to note that the system will remain constrained and vulnerable to additional breakdowns while recovery activities are in progress,” the power utility said. The group added that the unlawful and unprotected labour action, which has caused widespread disruption to Eskom’s power plants, means it is unable to return some generators to service. “This has compelled Eskom to continue taking precautionary measures to conserve emergency generation capacity and safeguard plant from damage. There remains a risk that the stage of load shedding may have to change at any time, depending on the state of the plant. “We currently have 3,161MW on planned maintenance, while another 17,395MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns.” Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

Many of South Africa’s popular banks plan to extend the number of branches where customers can get their smart ID cards or passports, and avoid the chaotic Home Affairs process. Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said in a parliamentary meeting last year, that the Department of Home Affairs’ partnership with banks is planned to extend to 70 branches. The department is set to roll out its expansion from 1 July 2022. First National Bank and Standard Bank make up the majority of home affairs supported bank branches while Capitec currently does not offer the service. Applicants who wish to use their personal bank are required to register on the E-Home Affairs system, book an appointment and then visit the bank to make payment and collect the important documents. The Department of Home Affairs also plans to expand its own E-services in the next few months to alleviate long queues and reduce strain on the department. The new system allows for clients to make a booking and visit the office on the date and time of the appointment without having to queue. According to the Department of Home Affairs Annual Report for 2020/2021, the department continues to face common challenges, namely, unstable and uninterruptable network infrastructure, long queues, insufficient and poor office accommodation, and capacity constraints.

The South Africa Post Office has launched an online service for the renewal of motor vehicle licences from any online device. The full renewal process, including payment, will be done online, leaving only the last step of accessing the actual disc, the post office said. This will be done in one of two ways: The Post Office can deliver the disc to the customer at an affordable delivery fee
The disk can be collected from a Post Office counter. “Payment is done safely and securely through Masterpass, which the user can download from the Google Play Store for Android devices and the Apple App Store for Apple devices. “No commission is charged on the renewal transaction. The cost of delivery to door is R75 and there is no charge to the customer when it is collected from a Post Office counter.” The customer will receive an SMS when the disk arrives at the destination Post Office for collection or when it goes out for delivery. The post office said customers can expect a turnaround time of three working days, while it may be up to two days longer for outlying areas. The service is available for vehicle owners in all provinces of South Africa except, currently, the Western Cape. The South African Post Office is working to extend the service to this province as well. The online renewal facility for motor vehicle licences supplements the renewal service at selected Post Office branches, and customers will still be able to renew their vehicle licences at these branches. Customers who renew a vehicle licence at a Post Office branch receive the new disc immediately. “The South African Post Office also offers bulk motor vehicle licence renewal for fleet operators and businesses, both big and small,” it said. “This service entails the collection of all necessary documentation from company premises, taking them back to the Post Office for processing, printing of the discs and delivery back to the offices of the customer.” Read: Driving licence extension proposed for South Africa

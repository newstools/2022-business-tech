The Hollard Insurance Group says that Willie Lategan, former group chief financial officer and currently CEO of Hollard’s short-term insurance arm, will take over from Saks Ntombela as chief executive officer with effect from 1 July 2022. Ntombela recently announced that he is leaving the group to join his family in Ireland, where his wife was recently appointed to a senior position at an international corporate, the group said. “This was an incredibly difficult decision given how much I believe in Hollard’s potential, but I could not see a way to operate a continent away from my young family,” said Ntombela. “I am pleased to be able to hand over the reigns to someone as demonstrably capable as Willie, who has shown from the very beginning an ability to drive effective performance in building a business, as well as a deep understanding of the markets in which we operate and the challenges we face as an insurer.” An actuary by training, Lategan was appointed CEO of Hollard’s short-term business unit in 2018, having joined as Group CFO in 2015. He holds a BCom (Hons) from the University of Stellenbosch and is a Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries, and a member of the Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA). Before joining Hollard, Lategan was Absa’s chief executive for Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance. Read: Banks send price hike warning to South Africa

One of these benefits is access to an online financial wellness tool that enables iMasFinance members to determine their level of financial wellness and they earn iMasRewards points when using this tool. iMasFinance also offers financial wellness workshops at all corporates that have an agreement with the Co-operative at no cost to the employer or the employee. These workshops are focused on basic but very important financial principles such as retirement planning, budgeting, saving and debt management. This is important as South Africa has a major challenge when it comes to saving and investing. For example, a poll by BusinessTech conducted earlier this year showed that 61% of South Africans are saving under 10% of their salary for their retirement. Data from debt counsellor DebtBusters also shows that consumers have 20% more unsecured debt on average in 2022 compared to 2016 – and this increases to 54% for people taking home R20,000 or more. “Financial wellness is an important part of a person’s overall personal wellbeing, which is why South Africans have to educate themselves on how to save and manage their money effectively,” said van Vollenhoven. “Our financial wellness workshops are geared towards helping South Africans develop better financial habits.” Forward-thinking businesses that have an agreement with iMasFinance also benefit significantly, in that they empower their workforce to live financially well. “It is a no-brainer – any forward-thinking business should invest in its workforce, and iMasFinance is the best way to do this,” said iMasFinance Head of Corporate Marketing and Communication, Nomtha Lusu.

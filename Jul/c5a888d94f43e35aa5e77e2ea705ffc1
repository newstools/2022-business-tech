KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has announced the introduction of new ‘premium comfort class’ seats which will be available on flights from South Africa in 2023. The new class is set to fit in between the existing economy and world business seats, and will feature a new type of seat and distinctive service and catering concepts. Depending on the aircraft type, the capacity of premium comfort class will vary from 21 to 28 seats, which will be wider than standard seats, offering more leg room, a larger screen and a footrest. Premium comfort seats can also recline further than economy class seats. The new seats in premium comfort class were designed by Collins Aerospace and specialists at KLM customer experience. Apart from their new design and comfort features, the seats are also lighter than previous designs. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-607758 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-2-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-2-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-607760 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-3-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-3-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KLM-3-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> On intercontinental services, one or two hot meals will be served, depending on the duration of the flight.

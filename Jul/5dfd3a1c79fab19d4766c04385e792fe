Makro has launched a new stand-alone shopping app for customers to make purchases on general merchandise, liquor and pantry items. The new app provides customers with access to over 120,000 products, marking a 30% expansion of Makro’s online product range since January, it said. Massmart has previously embarked on a multi-year e-commerce strategy by developing its website and app as more people move to buy products online. The app aims to make it easier to find new products and promotions online with improved search functionalities and reduced registration processes. “The launch of the Makro shopping App represents a further significant step in Massmart’s e-commerce journey and we look forward to serving even more online customers through this channel,” the group said. The Makro Shopping App is available for download from the Google Play and Apple App store. Read: Inflation hits 13-year high in South Africa – here are 8 things that are much more expensive

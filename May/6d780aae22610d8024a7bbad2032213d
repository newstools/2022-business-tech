African Bank has announced a deal to purchase Grindrod Bank and its holding company Grindrod Financial Holdings. Grindrod Bank is an investment bank established 26 years ago, which specialises in managing cash deposits, corporate and investment banking. It has typically been a niche financier in the South African property market known for its specialised expertise in commercial and industrial property finance. It also provides bespoke financial services to private, corporate and institutional clients. “A key part of African Bank’s ‘Excelerate25’ strategy is to expand its core. This acquisition will go a long way in delivering on this theme, and meeting its mission objectives of becoming scalable, diversified and sustainable, with a compelling listable proposition,” African Bank said in a shareholder statement on Thursday (26 May). “Grindrod Bank will provide an entry into the business banking market which will be grown off African Bank’s larger balance sheet and strong capital levels.” The total cash consideration payable to Grindrod in terms of the proposed transaction is R1.5 billion, with the deal still subject to regulatory approval.

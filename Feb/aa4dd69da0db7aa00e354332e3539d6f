The UK government has introduced a new tool to help foreign workers determine if they meet the conditions to qualify for a Skilled Worker visa according to the UK’s immigration points system. The UK introduced its new Skilled Worker visa in 2021, allowing holders to live and work in the UK for up to five years before extending it or applying for indefinite leave to remain in the UK, said Darren Faife, managing director of business immigration at Sable International. To apply for the Skilled Worker visa, applicants must obtain 70 points under the UK’s points-based system.  The mandatory requirements for the Skilled Worker visa are: A job offer by an approved sponsor (20 points)
Your job is at an appropriate skill level (20 points)
You speak English at the required level (10 points) “The remaining 20 points may be met by earning a salary at the ‘going rate’ for your occupation, having a job on the shortage list, or by holding a PhD in a subject relevant to your job or in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) subject,” said Faife. “However, if you can show you are a new entrant into the job market – for example, a recent university graduate –  the income requirements are lower.” Evaluating your job’s salary and eligibility requirements Faife noted that there are hundreds of eligible occupations, including hair salon owners, librarians, personal trainers and landscape gardeners. “Provided you have a job offer from a registered sponsor and you are earning at least the minimum required amount for your occupation, there is a good chance that you will meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker visa.” He provided an example of a person have been offered a position with a London landscaping company and they are offering you a salary of £11 an hour (which works out to an annual salary of £25,740 based on 37.5 hours per week) and you meet the knowledge of English requirement. “In this case, you will be eligible to apply for a Skilled Worker visa,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-556926 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Skilled-worker.png" alt="" width="1011" height="536" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Skilled-worker.png 1011w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Skilled-worker-300x159.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Skilled-worker-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: South African doctors and other professionals send warning to government: We can always leave

The National Treasury plans to expand and increase its ‘sugar tax’ on drinks in South Africa from next month. In 2018, Treasury introduced the Health Promotion Levy (HPL) on sugary drinks with more than four grams of sugar per 100 ml.  The rate is currently fixed at 2.1 cents per gram of the sugar content that exceeds four grams per 100ml, i.e. the first four grams per 100ml are levy-free. The tax, colloquially known as the “sugar tax”, is charged on non-alcoholic sugary beverages, except fruit juices, and practically works out to about 10%-11% per litre of the sugary drink. At the time, the government had reasoned that the policy would disincentivize the excessive consumption of sugar, which was seen as the driver of increasing non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The logic was that, over the long term, the sugar tax would reduce sugar consumption levels, thereby decreasing the prevalence of these diseases – which are currently also placing people at a higher risk of severe forms of Covid-19. Treasury has confirmed that the health promotion levy for beverages with more than 4g of sugar content per 100ml will be increased from 2.21c/g to 2.31c/g from 1 April 2022. Consultations will also be initiated to consider lowering the 4g threshold and extending the levy to fruit juices, it said.

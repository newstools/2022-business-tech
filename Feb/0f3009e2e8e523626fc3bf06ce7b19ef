The South African National Road Agency (Sanral) has notified the public and road users to expect deviations on the N1 just north of Musina in Limpopo. This is due to a necessary revised configuration on the N1 to enable the construction of a tie-in of the new Ring Road into the existing N1 between the old R572 intersection, the agency said. Hennie Kotze, project engineer at Sanral Northern Region, said construction is scheduled to take place from 15 February 2022 until 31 July 2022 and will result in the closure of the existing N1 between these two points. “Motorists and others using the N1 in both directions and those who wish to gain access to the R572 from the N1 and from the R572 will be affected. Access to and from Elias Ramuthivheli Street to these routes will also be affected,” he said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-558964" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/N1-R527.png" alt="" width="877" height="647" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/N1-R527.png 1130w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/N1-R527-300x221.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/N1-R527-1024x756.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/N1-R527-768x567.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-558962" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Road-work-ahead.png" alt="" width="875" height="591" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Road-work-ahead.png 1260w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Road-work-ahead-300x203.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Road-work-ahead-1024x692.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Road-work-ahead-768x519.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Road-work-ahead-1200x810.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The new ring road from Musina South to Musina North commenced in December 2019 and is set to be completed in 2022. The project’s main purpose is to divert the N1 traffic around the town of Musina, and is managed by the Raubex group. More than 1,000 heavy vehicles and trucks use the N1 passing through Musina city centre daily. Intersections and lower speed restrictions create heavy traffic congestion and damage to infrastructure in the town’s central business district. The road will ease congestion between Musina and Beit Bridge border post, a gateway to many other Sothern African Development Community countries that trade with South Africa, such as Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project has an estimated cost of R677 million. Sanral said road users will be accommodated with alternative routes as follows: From Musina along the N1 towards Beit Bridge and the R572
From Beit Bridge along the N1 towards the R572 & Musina
From R572 to Musina, Beit Bridge & Elias Ramuthivheli Street: “Sanral apologises for any inconvenience caused and appreciates the cooperation and patience of road users during the construction period. “We furthermore appeal to motorists to approach construction areas with caution, to reduce speed and always be on the lookout for pedestrians and construction workers. We will endeavour to complete the work as soon as possible,” said Kotze. Read: Energy minister warns of ‘huge’ petrol price increases due to Russia-Ukraine conflict

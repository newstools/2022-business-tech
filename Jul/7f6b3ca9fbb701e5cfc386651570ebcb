Eskom says that lower than anticipated demand on Friday (1 July) has given it room to reduce its planned stage 6 load shedding in the evening to stage 4. The new schedule is as follows: Friday (1 July) Stage 4 load shedding until 22h00
Stage 2 load shedding from 22h00 to 00h00 Saturday and Sunday (2 and 3 July) Stage 2 load shedding from 00h00 to 07h00
Stage 4 load shedding from 07h00 to 22h00
Stage 2 load shedding from 22h00 to 00h00 “Eskom cautions that this small reprieve is due to lower than anticipated demand during the weekend, and continues to evaluate the situation and closely monitor the system. We will communicate and implement any changes as may be necessary,” it said. On Friday afternoon the power utility said that it has 3,104MW on planned maintenance, with 17,431MW of capacity unavailable due to breakdowns.

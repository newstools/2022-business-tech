Retail banking group FNB has published its updated fee schedules for the next year – coming into effect from 1 July 2022. The bank has kept many of its fees the same, with any large increases due to structural changes. There has been a significant shift in how the bank is using its pricing structure to cultivate different transaction behaviour. Across its accounts, many standard transactions have ‘free’ limits in place before standard fees kick in. For example, banking customers on its entry-level account will be able to withdraw money at a cheaper rate (R7 per R1,000) for up to R2,000 before the standard ATM fee (R2.30 per R100) takes effect. On the middle market Aspire account, customers are able to withdraw up to R3,000 for free – either at tills or through ATMs – before the fee applies. Customers who take advantage of these limits and stay within them can avoid paying many common transactional fees. Those who step outside these limits, however, will find the standard fees to be much higher. One of the biggest changes FNB is making is waiving ‘other bank’ charges – the Saswitch fee charged when you use another bank’s ATMs – on certain days of the month. FNB says it will waive these fees on peak transactional days, specifically the 1st, 3rd, 25th and 31st (last day) of a month. The bank added that customers will also now only pay 50% of the FNB ATM cash withdrawal fee when they withdraw through cardless functionality on the FNB App. The table below outlines the monthly fee changes for its accounts: The fees below outline the standard rates (outside of account-specific limits and bundles) for the bank’s key transactional accounts. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289910" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FNB-Banner.png" alt="" width="640" height="100" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FNB-Banner.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FNB-Banner-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> * Up to R2,000, thereafter standard rate applies

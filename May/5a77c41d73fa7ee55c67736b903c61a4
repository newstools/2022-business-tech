The City of Tshwane says it has invested R46 million to upgrade the Bon Accord quarry crusher plant in Onderstepoort, to operate optimally and assist the municipality to produce and provide its own material for the building and maintenance of roads in the province. “Running our own crusher plant will assist Tshwane to accelerate repairing of potholes and reduce the current backlog,” said mayor Randall Williams on Tuesday (3 May). The refurbished plant will significantly assist us in increasing the production of hot asphalt so that we can ensure adequate maintenance of roads and pothole repairs across the city,” the mayor said.  The city said it will no longer procure asphalt mix from external service providers to fix potholes. “With this plant, the city will produce its own road building and maintenance materials. The materials will be used further for the city to produce its own hot-mix asphalt, ready-mix concrete and build/maintain tar roads,” it said. Mayor Williams said that heavy rains had significantly damaged the roads in recent months, following heavy criticism from residents in all areas of the province. “We are pushing to reduce potholes in the city,” he said.

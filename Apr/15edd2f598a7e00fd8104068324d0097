The Democratic Alliance has raised concerns about a spate of cycling crimes in Gauteng, with the party identifying several hotspot areas. The DA, which runs several coalition governments in the province, said it has seen an increase in the theft of bicycles as opportunistic criminals are targeting cyclists. It cited two recent incidents in Pretoria where two cyclists were knocked by a motor vehicle and then robbed of their bicycles. Another incident was also reported in Nelmapius where a cyclist was also involved in an accident where he was knocked by a motor vehicle, and they robbed him of his bicycle. In another incident, a woman was hijacked along Boeing Road in Nelmapius, and they took her bicycle and a phone. Some of the hotspots where cyclists and joggers are being robbed are roads surrounding: Boschkop;
Botha;
Centurion;
East of Pretoria;
Groenkloof Nature Reserve;
Highveld;
Irene;
Jean;
Lyttelton;
Migmatite;
Moreleta;
Olievenhoutbosch;
Van Ryneveld;
Waterkloof;
Witch-Hazel. The DA has now requested that the Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko ensure police visibility and increase road patrols, especially along the identified hot-spot routes. The party also wants the ANC to develop a safety plan to ensure the safety of cyclists and athletes. The routes used by the cyclists and joggers are mostly known and should be patrolled on a regular basis, it said. The DA also urged cyclists and joggers to cycle and jog in large groups and to ensure that no one is isolated during this time. Read: Warning over petrol price deregulation in South Africa

MyBroadband Insights has published its Q2 2022 Mobile Network Quality Report, detailing the best and worst mobile networks in South Africa right now. The MyBroadband Network Quality Report is based on results from MyBroadband’s Speed Test App which were recorded between 1 April 2022 and 30 June 2022. The download speed (60%), upload speed (20%), and latency (20%) are used to calculate a Network Quality Score. The network score is a value which shows the relative performance of networks, with a maximum score of 10. To ensure accurate results, unnatural results are filtered out, and cell down-sampling is used. The research shows that South Africa had an average mobile download speed of 49.92Mbps and an average upload speed of 14.84Mbps. MTN had the highest average download speed at 79.27Mbps, followed by Vodacom on 44.24Mbps, Telkom on 30.79Mbps, Cell C on 24.04Mbps and Rain on 14.55Mbps. <img class="size-full wp-image-605022 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB.png" alt="" width="777" height="634" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB.png 777w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB-300x245.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB-768x627.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “MTN’s exceptional performance results from a R50 billion network investment over the past five years, helping it to extend coverage, improve network quality, and increase speeds,” the group said. “MyBroadband Insights’ network performance data is in line with other independent network quality research, which also confirmed that MTN has the best network in South Africa. Over the last year, there has been a big network performance improvement for all operators. The average download speed in South Africa increased by 12Mbps as a result of the increased availability of 4G and 5G access across South Africa.” <img class="size-full wp-image-605024 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB-2.png" alt="" width="792" height="398" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB-2.png 792w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB-2-300x151.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MyBB-2-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To determine the best mobile network in South Africa, a ‘Network Quality Score’ was calculated for each network using download speed, upload speed, and latency. The Network Quality Score out of 10 then shows how a network performed in relation to other networks. MTN was ranked first with a Network Quality Score of 9.75, followed by Vodacom on 6.38, Telkom on 4.96, Cell C on 4.29, and Rain on 3.87.

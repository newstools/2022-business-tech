The Department of Public Service and Administration is in the process of finalising the ‘Public Service Occupational Dictionary’, which will serve as a definite handbook for government jobs in South Africa. While South Africa’s public sector jobs are already regulated, the government has grappled with rising wages, issues with verifying qualifications, and questions over whether employees are suitably qualified for certain positions. The dictionary aims to address this by acting as a formal document for government jobs in South Africa. The dictionary is based on inputs received by various government departments and will provide a detailed breakdown of all occupations and occupational groups within the government. It will also indicate the minimum qualifications and years of experience generally required for occupying jobs within occupational groups.  This information will be used to inform career paths – including front-facing services such as the South African Police Service. What government workers earn South Africa’s government currently employs around 13% of all workers in the country (around 1.2 million people) – yet it pays 33% of all wages. Responding in a written parliamentary Q&A in October 2021, public service and administration minister Ayanda Dlodlo said that there are currently 16 salary bands across the public service, with employees in band 1 earning an average salary of R103,562. By comparison, public sector workers in band 16 currently earn an average of over R2.1 million. Dlodlo also provided a breakdown of how many workers are in each salary band, with the largest number of workers falling between salary bands 5 and 9.

The recently published Hurun Global Rich List 2022 ranks over 3,300 billionaires from 69 different companies and 2,500 companies – including South Africa. The report highlights the industries and companies behind some of the wealthiest people in the world. Chairman and principal researcher of the report, Rupert Hoogewerf, said: “The Russia-Ukraine war, Covid-19, and the US-China Trade War all contributed to 337 billionaires going off the list this year, almost one a day.” Nevertheless, continuous economic digitisation, technological advancements, and inflation supported the addition of 490 new billionaires to the list, resulting in an unexpected net gain of 153 billionaires, said Hoogewerf. The report showed that the energy, biotech, luxury goods, semiconductor, software services and shipping industries had good results. Hoogewerf stressed that there are now 10 individuals with $100 billion in wealth, up from zero a mere five years ago. “At this rate, by 2030, expect to see 8,000 billionaires, 600 with $10 billion and more than fifty with $100 billion,” noted Hoogewerf. World’s most wealthy Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Alphabet fame joined the top 10 at the expense of Mark Zuckerburg and China-based Zhong Shanshan. Elon Musk of Tesla fame remains the richest man on the planet, with an estimated wealth of $205 billion. The table below details where and what the 10 wealthiest people in the world studied:

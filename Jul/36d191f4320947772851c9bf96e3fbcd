Power utility Eskom says that it will suspend load shedding earlier than expected, with no rolling blackouts expected this weekend. The stage 2 load shedding planned for 16h00 on Friday will also be downgraded to stage 1, it said. Stage 1 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00 until 00h00. Thereafter, load shedding will be fully suspended. “The generation system has recovered sufficiently at this point,” Eskom said. “While we are able to suspend load shedding at this point, Eskom cautions that the power system constraints persist. We urge the people of South Africa to continue using electricity sparingly.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-609966" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-22-July.png" alt="" width="662" height="312" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-22-July.png 1063w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-22-July-300x141.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-22-July-1024x483.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-22-July-768x362.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The threat of load shedding remains ever-present in South Africa, and will continue to linger over the heads of households until Eskom is able to build more capacity, it said. South Africa has experienced continuous load shedding for over a month, after Eskom was forced to push the rolling blackouts to stage 6 for several days following illegal strikes at its power stations. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the nation “soon” on a package of interventions from the government to tackle South Africa’s power crisis more urgently.

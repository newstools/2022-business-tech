Update: Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will now be implemented continuously starting at 17h00 on Monday until 05h00 on Wednesday due to a further breakdown at Medupi Unit 3. Original story Eskom has announced that it will reintroduce load shedding on Monday (7 March), due to multiple generating unit failures over the last 24 hours. Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 21h00 tonight to 05h00 on Tuesday, and be repeated from 21h00 on Tuesday night until 05h00 on Wednesday, it said. It added that these outages are necessary so that it can replenish its emergency reserves which had been depleted over the weekend. It cautioned that further load shedding may be introduced at short notice if there are any significant breakdowns. Eskom has warned in a summer load shedding forecast for 2021/2022, that its system is likely to remain severely constrained for the near future.

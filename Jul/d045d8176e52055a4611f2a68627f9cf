The latest Universum Talent Survey shows the companies South African professionals from various fields want to work for the most. The survey report is based on current employment trends, preferred employers, and the evolving talent needs in the current economic climate. “One of the biggest trends to look out for globally is the overarching evolution of employees’ need to belong,” said Pabi Mogosetsi, the country manager for Universum Global South Africa. According to the Manpower Group, economic activity is reverting to pre-pandemic levels, with data revealing that more employers will expect to hire talent in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Despite this, the ‘brain drain’ and skills shortage dilemmas remain a challenge to businesses, noted Mogosetsi. A particular point of interest is that more professionals are not as trusting in their organisation’s leadership as they may have been previously, Mogosetsi said. “6.2/10 of the respondents would recommend their current places of work to someone else, which is concerning considering that a satisfaction rating of 8/10 should be achieved.” When looking for new positions, working professionals are using networks and connections they have made in the industry and online reviews to make their choices on employer information. Mogosetsi said that both ethical standards and professional training and development are still highly regarded by professionals, with an emphasis being placed on secure employment over leadership opportunities. Remote work has also emerged as a new trend that working professionals favour.

Specialist professional recruitment firm Robert Walters has published its annual salary survey for 2022, detailing how much money professionals in accounting fields can expect to earn in South Africa over the coming year. Hiring in this sector picked up rapidly in 2021 and was only slowed down by the July riots seen in KZN and parts of Gauteng, said William Young, commerce and industry manager at Robert Walters. He said that there is strong demand for mid-senior finance rolls across all industries including retail, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and manufacturing. “The transition from face-to-face meetings to online platforms has made interviews more accessible and less time-consuming allowing a smoother more streamlined hiring process. Whilst there has been an increase in roles – this has not necessarily been through natural job creation but rather high levels of turnover.” “Clients across the hiring market are looking to bring in experienced professionals who can hit the ground running to negate the difficulties of training remotely.” Young said prospective hires are also expected to be flexible in working from home and potentially working on a contract basis.

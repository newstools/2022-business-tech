Global brand research group Brand Finance has published its 2022 Global 500 Banking report – ranking the most valuable banks in the world, including seven banks from South Africa. The report also ranks the top 10 strongest banking brands globally, with Capitec bank named as the second strongest in the world. In the main ranking, Brand Finance ranks banking groups by their brand value, which is calculated by measuring a brand’s performance on intangible measures, relative to its competitors. Factors that are considered include marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and the impact of those on business performance. Each brand is also assigned a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score out of 100, which feeds into the brand value calculation. Based on the score, each brand is assigned a corresponding rating up to AAA+ in a format similar to a credit rating. Chinese banks dominate ranking Chinese banks maintain the lead in the Brand Finance Banking 500 2022 ranking, accounting for one-third of total brand value and worth a cumulative $454.4 billion. While their global counterparts saw drops in brand value over the past two years, Chinese banks remained largely impervious to these issues. “A significant factor to this success was not only the nation’s timely response to the virus, but also the early and continued investment into digital development, allowing Chinese banks to continue engaging with their customers with relatively little disruption,” Brand Finance said. “Over the past year, China’s economy has continued to recover steadily despite a complex and ever-changing domestic and international environment. In the first half of 2021 alone, the nation’s GDP increased by 13% year-on-year.” The world’s largest bank by total assets, ICBC’s brand value has increased by 3% to $75.1 billion, making it the world’s most valuable banking brand again as well as the 8th most valuable brand across all industries <img class="size-full wp-image-554804 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Brand-Finance.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Brand-Finance.jpg 624w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Brand-Finance-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> South African banks by value No South African bank placed within the top 100, with Standard Bank, the highest placed local bank at 145th on the list. However, South Africa’s big banks fared well over the last year, all moving up the rankings. The most notable change among the local rankings was Standard Bank overtaking First national bank (FNB) to be ranked as the most valuable banking brand in the country. Rand Merchant Bank and Capitec also climbed significantly – up around 50 places in their respective rankings.

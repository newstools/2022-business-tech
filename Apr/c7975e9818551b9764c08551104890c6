The Shoprite Group has opened its first new format Checkers Foods supermarket in the Western Cape, targeting a smaller neighbourhood market compared to its existing regional stores. The 1,000 sqm Checkers Foods store is located in Franschhoek and includes a wine and cheese cellar and Starbucks. “We are thrilled to have found the perfect venue for this store concept and have fine-tuned the product offering to appeal to and serve all our customers in the area,” said Willem Hunlun, chief operating officer of Checkers. “With this new Checkers supermarket, we have also created employment in the area at a critical time, given the high unemployment levels, with a staff complement of 71 including 51 women,” he said. Checkers said that the new store includes: Freshly prepared sushi;
A meat market with free-range chicken and restaurant-quality steak;
A bakery with artisan breads;
Fresh fruit and vegetables;
A wine (pending liquor license approval) and cheese cellar;
Fresh flowers;
Starbucks; and
A money market counter. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-573598 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Checkers-Foods-1-1024x581.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="477" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Checkers-Foods-1-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Checkers-Foods-1-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Checkers-Foods-1-768x435.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Checkers-Foods-1-1200x680.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Checkers-Foods-1.jpg 1210w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> New format Shoprite opened its first standalone Checkers Food store in Gauteng at the end of 2021, with plans to expand to three further locations at the start of this year. In its annual results published on 8 March, the group said that it is increasingly focused on the mid-to-upper market segment. The group has also recently opened standalone pet and baby stores. It said it is also increasingly finding opportunities in adjacent avenues and partnerships that leverage the group’s existing business and substantial customer base, said Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive officer. <img class="size-full wp-image-541636 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-2.jpg 800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-541640 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-4.jpg" alt="" width="1338" height="893" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-4.jpg 1338w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-4-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-541642 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-5.jpg" alt="" width="1338" height="893" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-5.jpg 1338w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Checkers-5-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “In terms of category growth, as mentioned, we are extending our reach in pet, baby and health as well as beauty/pharmacy. “Notwithstanding these growth opportunities and the learnings that will come from them, the majority of future growth for the group will continue to be achieved from the pursuit of growth in our core supermarket business, underscored by our low-price leadership promise, whilst focusing on growing Checkers’ position in the mid-to-upper segment of the market.” Hunlun said the new Checkers Food Stores are specifically developed with local customers in mind. “We have spent a great deal of time to understand what our customers want and how they like to shop, and the new format Checkers Foods neighbourhood store was designed with the customer at the forefront,” said Hunlun. “The result is an improved shopping experience with fantastic fresh foods on offer, together with the convenience, quality, value and competitive pricing customers have come to expect from Checkers.” Read: Shoprite wants to position Checkers in the mid-to-upper market – as it targets pet, baby and health

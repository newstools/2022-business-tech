New World Wealth and Henley & Partners have published their African Wealth report for 2022, detailing the education trends of South Africa’s wealthiest citizens. The report focuses on high net worth individuals (HNWIs) with a wealth of $1 million (R15.70 million) or more. Total wealth refers to the private wealth held by all the individuals living in each country. It includes all their assets  –  property, cash, equities, business interests – less liabilities. The largest portion of the country’s HNWIs acquired their wealth through financial and professional services (including banks, law firms, accountants, fund managers and wealth managers), followed by the real estate sector. The technology and telecoms sector also ranks highly on the list for acquiring wealth. The data shows that South Africa’s HNWIs typically studied either law, finance or accounting degrees when at university. The University of Cape Town is the most popular university among HNWIs (20%), followed closely by the University of the Witwatersrand (18%) and Stellenbosch University (13%).

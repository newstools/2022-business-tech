South Africa’s most prominent medical insurance provider, Discovery, has announced its new private health cover at a third of the price of its previous entry-level product to attract new customers at an affordable rate. Discovery Health said it would offer primary care for about R350 a month, giving customers access to doctors, emergency procedures and treatment for chronic conditions including HIV. Discovery is not the only insurer taking steps to acquire its portion of the market to address the nearly 8 million uninsured South Africans and sliding health insurance membership in 2020 due to a stagnant economy reducing disposable income. Dis-Chem Pharmacies and digital bank Tyme have launched insurance offerings to tap into the country’s wider and under-served segment. Dis-chem is set to offer an R431 monthly fee whereas TymeHealth will charge R139, depending on the type of cover sought. The chief executive officer of Discovery, Adrian Gore said that as Covid hit, the group saw correlations of risk factors such as diabetes and high body mass index as drivers of higher levels of severe disease and death. He stressed that this has, in turn, increased people’s “sense of wellness and resilience and why it is important”. BusinessTech compiled a list of medical aid schemes offered by popular providers based on their affordability and price entry points.

The Department of Basic Education was asked to identify the top-performing schools in every province in South Africa, and identified over 320 and public schools that attained a 100% pass rate in the 2021 matric exams. Responding to parliamentary Q&A this week, the department split the top performers across English-speaking, Afrikaans-speaking and dual-medium schools. According to the department, most of the top-performing schools are English-speaking, making up 212 of the total identified. There were 57 Afrikaans medium schools, and 55 dual-medium schools identified. While the department identified 324 public schools that had an exceptional performance in the 2021 matric exams, its assessment report goes even further and lists the schools that have put in a consistently perfect performance over the last five years. Here, it listed 91 schools that have attained a 100% matric pass rate since 2017. Most of the schools are located in the country’s biggest economic centres in Gauteng (25 schools), KwaZulu-Natal (22 schools) and Cape Town (22 schools), with the Free State also featuring a large number of schools (14). The North West has four schools in the perfect ranking, followed by the Eastern Cape with two, and Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape with one school each. No schools from Limpopo feature on the list. Of all the schools that managed to maintain a perfect matric pass rate for five years, Phumanyova High in Zululand, KZN, had the highest number of matriculants in 2021, with all 350 learners who sat the exams passing. This was followed by Hoërskool Waterkloof in Tshwane, Gauteng, with 316 learners, and Afrikaanse Hoër Meisieskool in the same region, with 249.

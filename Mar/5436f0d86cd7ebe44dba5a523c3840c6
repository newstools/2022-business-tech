The new Mitsubishi Triton GL has reached South African shores with the aim of being an affordable pickup for fleet owners and small and medium enterprises. “At the competitive price of R469,995 – The Triton Double Cab GL features an intercooled turbodiesel engine, with 100kW of power and 324Nm of peak torque, making the range more accessible than ever before,” said Mitsubishi. The new bakkie is exclusively available as a 4×2 with a six-speed transmission and offers 8.0 litres/100km. The Triton GL includes an anti-lock braking system, electric brakeforce distribution (EBD) and child seat anchors, while creature comforts include keyless entry, central locking, an immobiliser, electric windows, an automatic air-conditioning system and a touchscreen with Android Auto or Apple Car play as an optional extra. The Triton comes at a time when the South African bakkie market is eagerly awaiting updated versions of staple brands including the 2022 Ford Ranger. The next-generation Ford Ranger is set to be introduced in the second quarter of 2022 and bring with it a 3.0 litre, V6 engine.

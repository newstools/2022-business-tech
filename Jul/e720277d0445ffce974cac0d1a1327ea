Data from the Household Affordability Index by the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice & Dignity group (PMBEJD) shows a continuation in food price hikes in July. The index showed that the average cost of its Household Food Basket climbed 1.3% – or R60.06 – to R4,748 in July 2022. Year-on-year, the average cost of the Household Food Basket increased by R611.44 (14.8%), from R4,137 in July 2021. The 14.8% hike is well above headline inflation (CPI) recorded in July at 7.4% and far outstrips reported food inflation at 8.6%. The zero-rated foods in the household food basket increased by R58,75  – or 24% – to R2,502 month on month, and by R398,85 (19%) to R2 502,59 year-on-year. The group also published its Household Domestic & Personal Hygiene Index for July 2022, showing how these items have increased since the start of the year. “Domestic and personal hygiene products are critical expenses for safe hygiene and overall health and well-being. The money needed to secure domestic and personal hygiene products are sourced from within the food budget. These products compete viciously in the food budget,” it said. Month-on-month, the cost of the household domestic and personal hygiene products basket increased by R36,86 – or 4.4% from R839,75 in June 2022 to R876,61 in July 2022. Year on year, the cost of the household domestic and personal hygiene products basket increased by R151,89 – or 21% – from R724,72 in July 2021 to R876,61 in July 2022. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-611990" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FoodBasket-1.png" alt="" width="1138" height="531" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FoodBasket-1.png 1138w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FoodBasket-1-300x140.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FoodBasket-1-1024x478.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FoodBasket-1-768x358.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Massive food price increases in South Africa – here’s what you’re paying more for

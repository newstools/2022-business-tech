Edgars, recently acquired by the Retailability group, has announced a major new delivery push in South Africa. The retailer said this will include a partnership with last-mile logistics company Pargo for nationwide click-and-collect services. In addition, Edgars said it is also adding over 100 of its own stores to the growing network of over 3,000 Pargo Pickup Points – making this the largest pickup point network in South Africa. The expansion will allow customers to collect their online orders at a nearby pickup point. “In addition to convenience, click and collect also offers customers living in difficult-to-reach areas, rural areas and informal settlements access to the wide range of Edgars brands and products, giving them the opportunity to shop online without the worry that they’ll either miss a delivery or not even qualify for delivery at all,” it said. “Though e-commerce is growing exponentially in South Africa, delivery can still be tricky for many, especially for those living in regional or outlying areas,” said Richard Mclennan, head of e-commerce at Retailability. “It is our aim to deliver on the convenience of online shopping by giving everyone an opportunity to easily get their order no matter where they are in the country. That is why a partnership with Pargo makes so much sense.” Read: Big shopping changes for South Africa – including price hikes

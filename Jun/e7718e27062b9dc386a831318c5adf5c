The latest Household Affordability Index by the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice & Dignity group (PMBEJD) shows that food prices continued to climb in May 2022. The group recorded its Household Food Basket at R4,609.89 in May 2022. Month-on-month, the average cost of the basket increased by R66.96 (1.5%), from R4,542.93 in April 2022. Year on year, the basket is up by R472.78 (11.4%), from R4,137.11 in May 2021. The year-on-year increase outstrips headline inflation by quite a large margin, and even food inflation tracked by Stats SA. The latest Consumer Price Index for April 2022 shows that headline inflation is 5.9%, and food inflation was recorded at 6.2%. According to the PMBEJD, the same factors that have caused the upward trend in prices have run into May, and are likely to keep price pressure up for the remainder of the year. These factors include Covid-19; the Russia/Ukraine conflict; local climatic disasters such as the recent flooding in Kwa Zulu Natal; and social unrest and general daily protests – which disrupt logistics and production. “We need to seriously re-think our levels of exposure to global commodity price movements and speculation, and in the long food supply chains, which impact negatively on household food security,” the group said. “Our over-exposure to global supply lines suggests that we need to build national capacity and reserves as an immediate and long-term mitigation strategy, including investing more in local agricultural input capacity, and smallscale farmers to produce food closer to the table where it is consumed. “Ensuring household food security is a primary function of government. There is a direct correlation between household food security and societal stability and with increasing household food insecurity the risk of social instability has increased significantly,” it said. Food prices The PMBEJD basket comprises 44 core food items most frequently purchased by lower-income households, who make up most households in the country. Year on year, only five of these 44 items have come down in price, with one remaining unchanged. The balance – 38 items –have  all increased in price over the last 12 months. These were the most significant changes, where prices increased or declined by 10% or more. Food prices May 2021 to May 2022 – big changes Cooking oil: +53%

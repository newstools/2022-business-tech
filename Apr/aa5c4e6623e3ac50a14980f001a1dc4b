New World Wealth and Henley & Partners have published their African Wealth report for 2022, detailing the spending and travel trends of South Africa’s wealthiest citizens. The report focuses on high net worth individuals (HNWIs) with a wealth of $1 million (R15.70 million) or more. Total wealth refers to the private wealth held by all the individuals living in each country. It includes all their assets  –  property, cash, equities, business interests – less liabilities. The data shows that the following South African towns and villages are becoming increasingly popular among HNWIs. Hermanus <img class="aligncenter wp-image-435195 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hermanus-1-1024x650.png" alt="" width="840" height="533" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hermanus-1-1024x650.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hermanus-1-300x190.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hermanus-1-768x488.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hermanus-1.png 1164w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The fastest-growing South African town for HNWIs.

There are also several exclusive residential estates in this area that have attracted HNWIs, including Val de Vie, De Zalze and Domaine des Anges. In addition, many of South Africa’s wealthiest families (especially centi-millionaires) own wine farms in this area.

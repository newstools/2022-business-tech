Fashion retailer the Cotton On Group has joined several other leading name brands in South Africa by moving its headquarters and central distribution centre to Waterfall. Situated in Waterfall Logistics Hub, construction of the R300 million 22,000 sqm purpose-built campus commenced in January 2021, and since June 2022, 2.2 million units – more than 100 truckloads of stock have been moved from Cotton On’s former premises in Pomona to its new state of the art premises. Attacq development executive David Oosthuizen said: “Waterfall connects sector players to a like‐minded community of shared interests and goals. Welcoming a strong brand such as Cotton On to the Logistics Hub solidifies the precinct’s ability to attract blue-chip businesses due to its combination of visibility and accessibility along national logistics routes, as well as its proximity to Waterfall’s retail and lifestyle offering.” The new campus is geared to processing 6,000 e-commerce orders per day, 200,000 units to its retail network daily and over 20 million units per year. The centre features Very Narrow Aisle (VNA) storage and a pick mezzanine for unitised picking for store, wholesale and e-commerce orders. Built for growth and scale, an additional 50% of space will cater for future e-commerce processing. The headquarters and distribution centre combines grey water harvesting, a 200 kWp solar power plant, LED lighting, proximity sensors to reduce energy usage and an indigenous landscape. Additionally, the company is currently transitioning all plastic polybags to be made with recycled plastic. As businesses adapt to new ways of working and innovating, the Cotton On campus comprises open workspaces that encourage conversation and collaboration. Each of the company’s divisions has its own brand room that represents the core themes of its brand. Both the head office and warehouse staff enjoy the same facilities and services with welcoming entrances and chill areas replicated at both entry points. There is a state-of-the-art gym with personal trainers available, meal delivery services, coffee machines, WiFi, and plants to increase productivity and replenish focus. “Our products are pretty magical and so is our team. The new bespoke site has been designed to deliver the best possible experience for our customers and to provide our team with a great place to work,” said Natalie Wills, country manager for the Cotton On group. “The campus was designed with a ‘people first’ culture approach, which underpins what our brand stands for, puts us in good stead to continue our excellent customer service processes, and is an extension of our commitment to making a positive impact in all areas of our business,” she said. Leading brands such as BMW Group SA, Cummins, Massbuild, Vantage, Dis-Chem, Pirtek, Zimmer Biomet, Superga, GloTool and Dimension Data also call Waterfall home ‐ and use the precinct’s many benefits to underpin their daily business operations and strategic goals. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-609794" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn7-scaled-e1658478759333.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn7-scaled-e1658478759333.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn7-scaled-e1658478759333-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn7-scaled-e1658478759333-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn7-scaled-e1658478759333-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-609804" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn10-e1658479333662.png" alt="" width="1200" height="706" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn10-e1658479333662.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn10-e1658479333662-300x177.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn10-e1658479333662-1024x602.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn10-e1658479333662-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-609806" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn11-e1658479356287.png" alt="" width="1200" height="741" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn11-e1658479356287.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn11-e1658479356287-300x185.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn11-e1658479356287-1024x632.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn11-e1658479356287-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-609808" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn13.png" alt="" width="776" height="796" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn13.png 776w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn13-292x300.png 292w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn13-768x788.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-609810" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn12-e1658479436862.png" alt="" width="1200" height="713" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn12-e1658479436862.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn12-e1658479436862-300x178.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn12-e1658479436862-1024x608.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CottonOn12-e1658479436862-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Government has promised to build new smart cities in South Africa – but this developer is actually doing it

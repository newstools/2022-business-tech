Statistics South Africa has published its latest consumer price index, showing that annual consumer price inflation has broken through the upper limit of the Reserve Bank’s target range. Inflation was recorded at 6.5% in May 2022, up from 5.9% in April 2022. This is the highest reading since January 2017 when the rate was 6.6%, with inflation now higher than the upper limit of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy target range of 6%, pointing to further interest rate hikes in July. Transport and food and non-alcoholic beverages (NAB) accounted for just over half of the annual rate, with sharp price increases recorded in both categories. Fuel, in particular, continues to be a major contributor: if the impact of fuel is removed from the CPI reading in May, the headline rate falls to 5.1% from 6.5%. Diesel prices jumped by 8.1% between April and May, taking the annual rate to over 45%. The average price of a litre of diesel in May 2021 was R16.20 – meaning it costs R729 to fill a 45-litre tank. Twelve months later, with the average price at R23.67 per litre, filling the same tank cost R1,065. Petrol prices moderated between April and May, edging lower by 0.7%. Despite this decline, petrol is almost 27% more expensive than it was in May 2021. Some of the largest annual price increases (May 2021 vs May 2022) were recorded for the following goods and services: Fuel: +32.5%

South African motorists can expect to pay record amounts to fill up their cars this week, with the cost of diesel and petrol set to climb by around R1.46 per litre on Wednesday (2 March). The increases for March are mainly attributable to rising international petroleum prices as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and would have been more severe had the rand not stabilised against the US Dollar in the last few weeks. The increases have pushed fuel prices in South Africa to record highs. For the first time in history, 95 octane petrol inland will rise above R21 a litre, and by a significant margin. As of Wednesday, this fuel will cost R21.60/l while at the coast it will cost R20.88/l, the first time it has breached the R20/l level, the Automobile Association said. This is how the prices will reflect at the pumps when factoring in the slate levy and other costs.

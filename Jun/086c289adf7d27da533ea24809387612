State power provider, Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will be introduced from 17h00 – 22h00 this evening. “Due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, load shedding will be implemented every evening at the same time until Thursday night. Eskom will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary,” it said in a statement on Monday (20 June 2022). It further appealed to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items. The power utility said it currently has 5,232MW on planned maintenance, while an additional 14,202MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “Eskom cautions the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks. “We would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We, therefore, urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially between 05h00 – 09h00 in the mornings and 16h00 – 22h00 in the evenings,” it said.

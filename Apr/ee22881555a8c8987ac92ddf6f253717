Retailer Dis-Chem Pharmacies has partnered with chat commerce specialist Clickatell, to enable WhatsApp as its customer communication channel to engage with its customers. Dis-Chem customers can now quickly and easily access various services through WhatsApp by sending “Hi” to 0860 347 243. The menu then allows shoppers to choose which action they want to perform including: Registering for a Benefit Card
Existing members can update their personal details
Checking loyalty points
Reporting lost or stolen cards and receiving a digital replacement immediately
Registering for Dis-Chem’s Baby Programme Dis-Chem will also use the channel to alert customers when their repeat medication is due for collection, or when delivery from their preferred store is ready through “Pack My Meds”. Pack My Meds is Dis-Chem’s online repeat medicine ordering platform. “Consumers have shown they prefer to use chat channels, and WhatsApp in particular, to engage with each other and with their favourite brands,” said Clickatell commercial senior vice president for growth markets Werner Lindemann. “Delivering the WhatsApp channel to our customers resolves an immediate customer experience need, adds to our ability to continue to deliver superior convenience, and gives us an excellent opportunity to expand our digital offering in the future,” said Dis-Chem loyalty and consumer rewards head Lynne Blignaut. “Our teams have worked closely to ensure our customers will find the user interface intuitive and the service immediately convenient and valuable.” Read: Deleting or sending these WhatsApp messages can get you in trouble at work in South Africa

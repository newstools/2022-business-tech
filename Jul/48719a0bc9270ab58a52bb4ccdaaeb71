The new Irene Link retail mall in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality is nearing completion, with the development on track to open to the public on 29 September 2022. The mall forms part of phase 2 of Abland’s R2 billion Irene Link smart precinct development, which began construction in 2019. The 75,000 square metre mixed-use precinct is situated next to the Irene Security Estate in Doringkloof and is already home to several commercial buildings, including the Barloworld Logistics head office and other campus-like offices. It was developed in partnership with Giflo Developments and the SOM Group. The mall is located on Alexander Avenue, just off Botha Avenue near the N1. According to Giflo Developments, the anchor tenants for the mall include Checkers, Woolworths, and Dis-Chem, while the centre will boast the only 200 metre underground shooting range in the country. Irene Arms is a gun and outdoor shop with a coffee shop offering. It also has a 10-lane, 25 metre indoor hand weapon shooting as well as a 10-lane 200 metre indoor rifle shooting range. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-603806"

smart cities in Gauteng. “At this infrastructure phase, the connectivity of the precinct is planned to link all the functions of the precinct into a smart city with interconnected buildings and security, smart taxi drop-offs and a public WiFi area. “We are also designing a Green Star-rated precinct from the ground up and each building on its own is Green Star-rated. This will include backup water and power, with renewable solar energy,” he said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-603780" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Irene-Link-Precinct-June-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="974" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Irene-Link-Precinct-June-2022.jpg 1500w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Irene-Link-Precinct-June-2022-300x195.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Irene-Link-Precinct-June-2022-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Irene-Link-Precinct-June-2022-768x499.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Irene-Link-Precinct-June-2022-1200x779.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> There are also plans for a future Gautrain station and bus stations in the vicinity, which is expected to augment interest in the node.

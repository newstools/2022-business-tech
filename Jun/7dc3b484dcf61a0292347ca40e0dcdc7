Power utility Eskom has warned that its system is severely constrained and load shedding may be implemented at short notice, should there be any significant breakdowns. Due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, the power system is very constrained for this evening and will be for the next few weeks, it said on Monday (20 June). While a number of generating units are expected to return to service during the day, the likelihood of load shedding is high, most likely during the evening periods of 17h00 and 22h00, it said. “Eskom will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary. We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items. “Eskom cautions the public that the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks.” The power utility added that load shedding is only introduced as a last resort to protect the energy grid and that South Africans should reduce power usage during peak periods such as 05h00 – 09h00 and 16h00 – 22h00.

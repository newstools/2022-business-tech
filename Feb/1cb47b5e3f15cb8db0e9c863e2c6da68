Local large-format and cutting systems specialist AM.CO.ZA has assembled a range of Heatware heat presses for every application. These heat press options include heat transfer vinyl printing (printed or solid colour), DTF printing (used on T-shirts), and heat-based sublimation printing – a process that changes ink from solid to gas and back to solid (used on coffee mugs).

This complex goal means that heat presses are generally high-ticket items and customers’ choices are often limited by price. However, Advanced Machinery is changing this by offering a comprehensive range of heat presses for a wide range of applications at affordable prices. AM.CO.ZA’s product range includes products for those who are performing small volumes of specific tasks – such as T-shirt and mug printing – as a hobby. The product range includes multifunction heat presses that support T-shirt pressing in the sizes 290 x 380mm (bust size), 380 x 380mm (half size), and 400 x 600mm (full size). <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> The T-shirt range also comprises a flat press with a 38cm x 38cm size in the clamshell opening style, a flat press of the same size but with a swing-away opening, and a flat press with a swing-away opening for sizes up to 40cm x 60cm – known as the full-size press. Alongside its T-shirt presses, AM.CO.ZA also offers mug and pen presses in its single-application range. This includes a model capable of pressing a single mug, a model capable of pressing up to five mugs simultaneously, and a press capable of handling up to six pens at a time. Other single-use presses include a small portable unit that is ideal for sublimation printing or for hobbyists who may want to print and press at a market stall, while if you’re running a high-production business, there is also a large press with a roll-to-roll feed that will be ideal for your needs. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-557960" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Roller.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Roller.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Roller-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The multi-function heat press range of AM.CO.ZA is designed to serve a wide spectrum of customers through models that can adapt according to the specific and changing production requirements of each user.

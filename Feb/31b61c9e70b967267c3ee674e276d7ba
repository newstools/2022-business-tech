Eskom has announced that it will introduce stage 2 load shedding on Wednesday (2 February), due to ongoing power constraints. Following further breakdowns during the night, load shedding will begin at 11h00 on Wednesday until 05h00 on Monday (7 February). “This load shedding is necessary due to a shortage of generation capacity following breakdowns of two more generating units during the night. “Since the weekend Eskom has utilised significant amounts of emergency generating reserves, which have now been depleted and need to be replenished. Eskom will use this period to replenish the emergency generation reserves,” it said. Total breakdowns amount to 14,99wMW while planned maintenance is 4,435MW of capacity. The group said it will communicate further if there are any significant changes to the power system.  Eskom has warned in a summer load shedding forecast for 2021/2022, that its system is likely to remain severely constrained for the near future.

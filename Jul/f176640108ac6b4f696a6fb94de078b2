Eskom chief executive Andre de Ruyter says that South Africa is set to continue with load shedding for the coming week, with no immediate plans to stop the outages. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday morning (11 July), De Ruyter said the power utility is currently facing total unplanned outages of 14,487MW. He added that Eskom is forecast to have a capacity shortfall for much of the current week, with alternating load shedding stages to be introduced at various stages in the coming days. The current forecast is as follows: Stage 4 load shedding will continue on Monday until 00h00;
Stage 2 load shedding will be introduced from 00h00 – 05h00 on Tuesday, before moving to stage 4 load shedding between 05h00 and 00h00;
This schedule is set to repeat (stage 2 and stage 4) on Thursday and Friday;
If all units return as planned, Eskom will move to ‘permanent’ stage 2 load shedding over the weekend. On a more positive note, de Ruyter said that Eskom has been able to recover some of its diesel reserve capacity in recent days, while the return of Koeberg unit 2 at the end of July is expected to add a further 900MW to the grid. De Ruyter said that Eskom is expected to add substantial capacity over the next 18-24 months which is expected to ease the load shedding burden on the country. “There is light at the end of the tunnel but we appeal to South Africans to continue to conserve electricity,” he said.

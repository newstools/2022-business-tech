Nedbank says it is accelerating the rollout of its ‘new concept’ service design to all branches in South Africa. The group has set a target of reformating 100 branches, intending to complete between 15 and 20 branches every month during the second half of the year. The new branch design focuses on convenience and digital self-service banking and introduces features like an appointment booking system through the banking app suite. Clients are able to use their Nedbank Money app or Nedbank Online Banking to pre-book a date and time with a branch consultant and don’t have to wait in a queue to get face-to-face financial guidance or assistance. In-branch, the customers are presented with three distinct service zones, offering self-service, staff-assisted service or expert money advice. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-587246" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-03.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-03.jpg 1773w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-03-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-587248" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-02.jpg" alt="" width="1011" height="674" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-02.jpg 1773w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-02-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-587250" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-01.jpg" alt="" width="1013" height="675" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-01.jpg 1773w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nedbank-Concept-01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Werner Terblanche, managing Executive: Nedbank Integrated Channels, said: “All feedback points to high levels of client appreciation of the new formats, which give them the flexibility of a ‘hybrid’ service approach, effectively allowing them to choose how they want to engage with us.” This feedback pushed Nedbank to roll out the format to all of its branches. Further insights showed that one of the main reasons most clients have for visiting a branch is to collect their bank cards. This, despite Nedbank still providing various other ways for cards to be received. “Many of our clients still feel more confident collecting their new or replacement cards in person,” Terblanche said. “Our revamped branches make this process quicker and more convenient for them.” The branches offer self-service card dispensing kiosks that instantly issue clients with their new Nedbank card. Card collection lockers are also being placed in the main Nedbank branches, allowing clients to arrange the collection of their new or reissued Nedbank cards without having to queue. “In addition to these reimagined branches, we are also steadily growing our network of workplace and mobile community bankers to take our banking services directly to our clients. In addition, our partnerships with Boxer, Cashbuild, Hinterland and other retailers ensure our clients have many other convenient points of access to meet their banking servicing needs and we look grow this even further over time,” he said. Nedbank is on a drive to cut back its physical presence, having already reduced its branch footprint to 538 in 2021 from 549 in 2020, and 604 in 2018. Branch space is also being reduced, it said.

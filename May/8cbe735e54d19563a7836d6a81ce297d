BusinessTech will hold its inaugural Online FinTech Conference on 20 July 2022. The BusinessTech Online FinTech Conference is an exclusive event for high-level banking, ICT, and FinTech executives and professionals – and has been launched thanks to strong demand from BusinessTech’s partners and clients for a FinTech-focused event. The conference will cover a variety of topics, including FinTech disruption, mobile payments, digital banking, cryptocurrency, blockchain, cyber security, AI, and machine learning. 2,500 delegates are set to attend the online event, which will be hosted on a dedicated event platform. Following its unveiling earlier this month, BusinessTech has quickly secured key partnerships for the FinTech conference. The Online FinTech Conference will be hosted by respected business personality Michael Avery. Avery is well known and respected in business circles, and is the perfect host for this cutting-edge event. Nedbank has joined the conference as an Event Partner, and Divisional Executive of Emerging Payments at Nedbank Chipo Mushwana will be a featured speaker at the event. Mushwana will be joined by Bank Zero cofounder Michael Jordaan, who will delve into the latest trends in the industry as a featured speaker. BusinessTech has a range of sponsorship opportunities available which allow your business to take part in the FinTech conference.

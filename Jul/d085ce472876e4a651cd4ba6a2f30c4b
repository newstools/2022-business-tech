Power utility Eskom has announced that stage 4 load shedding will be introduced from Friday (8 July) as several generating units have been brought online. Over the next two days, load shedding will be implemented as follows: Friday (8 July) Stage 2 load shedding from 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 4 load shedding from 05h00 to 00h00 Saturday (9 July) Stage 2 load shedding from 00h00 to 07h00
Stage 3 load shedding from 07h00 to 00h00 Sunday (10 July) Stage 2 load shedding from 00h00 to 16h00
Stage 3 load shedding from 16h00 to 00h00 While the load shedding schedules from Friday, Saturday and Sunday are confirmed, the planned outages on Monday and Tuesday next week are not. The placeholder schedules for these days are stage 2 and stage 3 load shedding for Monday, and stage 2 load shedding for Tuesday., Eskom said. <img class="size-full wp-image-604378 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="502" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-1.png 800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-1-300x188.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-1-768x482.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />“Since the last communication, seven-generation units have been returned to service. During the same period, six generating units that needed urgent repairs during the strike have been taken offline for repairs. This is made possible by the full return to work of all striking employees over the past two days. “In addition, 600MW of capacity from the Hydroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB) in Mozambique was returned to service, boosting available generation capacity.” Over the next few days nine generation units are anticipated to return to service, which will further improve generation capacity, the power utility said. “This will, however, still require Eskom to continue implementing load shedding for the foreseeable future until the situation has been normalised. Emergency generation reserves, which have been extensively utilised to limit the stage of loadshedding over the past two weeks, have been adequately replenished and will continue to be used to limit the stage of load shedding.” Eskom said it currently has 3,349MW on planned maintenance, while another 16,865MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. The group said that it continues to closely monitor the system and will implement and communicate any changes as may be necessary. “Eskom would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We, therefore, urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially during these uncertain times on the power system.”  Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

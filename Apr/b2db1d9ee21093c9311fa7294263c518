Discovery’s recent financial results show how it is carving into South Africa’s affluent market, accounting for a 20% market share of people who earn R100,000 or more each month. Despite some banks targeting the low to the middle-income bracket in recent years with low-cost or zero-fee accounts like Nedbank’s MobiMoney or Standard Banks MyMo Account, the country’s thinning, but high income bracket remains a lucrative pool for many banks, including Discovery. Discovery Bank, which launched in mid-2019, has the highest barrier of entry bank account among all other retail banks called the ‘Discovery Bank Purple Suite’. The qualifying income for a prospective cardholder is no less than R2.5 million annually, which is equivalent to a monthly salary of just over R208,000. Discovery’s brochure outlines that the Purple Suite offers bespoke features and rewards for high net worth individuals. Rewards include up to 75% off on local and international flights, free international travel insurance, unlimited airport lounge visits, and faster security clearance at OR Tambo or Cape Town international airports. Discovery’s interim financial results for the period December 2021 showed that the bank continued to gain traction with 385,200 clients versus 287,182 clients in December 2020 – and 830,263 accounts versus 540,252 accounts a year earlier. Competitors to Discovery’s Purple Suite include FNB’s Private Wealth account which is for business owners or individuals earning more than R1.8 million a year or who have a net asset value in excess of R15 million and, Nedbank’s Private Wealth account, which is tailored towards individuals with an annual income of more than R1.5 million or those who have R5 million in investable assets. What they offer clients Bank accounts catered towards high-income earners usually provide enticing perks, focusing primarily on lifestyle, travel, and ease of business benefits such as cheaper or free flights and free access to airport lounges. Discovery Purple The Discovery Purple account for example requires a monthly payment of R570 and an annual payment of R2,950. Rewards include 65% back on healthy food, 75% off fitness gear, and 100% off gym membership at a Planet Fitness or Virgin Active in South Africa. To maintain qualification for certain benefits such as savings on business class flights, Discovery stressed that a cardholder is required to maintain a monthly salary of R208,000 for 12 consecutive months.

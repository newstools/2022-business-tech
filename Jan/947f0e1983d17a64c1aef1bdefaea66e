The sixth season of BusinessTech’s online talk show, Business Talk, is coming soon. The season is sponsored by Monocle, a leading management consulting firm specialising in banking and insurance, and will feature discussions with many top South African finance, investment, insurance, and business leaders. These guests include FNB CEO Jacques Cilliers and Bank Zero’s Co-Founder, Michael Jordaan, while topics will include business leadership, global consulting, and the latest executive trends. The interviews will also provide rare insight into the South African market and economy, with each guest expanding into their respective area of expertise. Business Talk is hosted by popular radio and TV personality Michael Avery, who is best known for being the anchor of the Business Day TV show, the Classic Business show on Classic FM, and the HOT Business show on HOT 1027. Avery’s fantastic interview style has helped to grow Business Talk’s audience significantly since its launch in November 2020, and the show has achieved well over 1 million views. The new episodes will be available on the Business Talk website, as well as on BusinessTech’s YouTube and Facebook pages. You can also watch all five previous seasons on these platforms.

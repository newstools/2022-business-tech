Jeep has announced pricing and details for its new Gladiator Rubicon pickup, which the group is positioning as its ‘ultimate adventure vehicle’ in the South African market. The 2022 Gladiator Rubicon features a 3.6-litre Pentastar V6 engine delivering 209kW and 347Nm of torque and features ESS as standard equipment. Jeep said the engine is engineered to provide a broad torque band with a focus on low-end torque, an essential trait needed for extreme off-roading. “There has been tremendous demand for this unique vehicle from our loyal Jeep customers and double cab buyers all over the world. South Africans’ affinity to pickups or bakkies is well established and we believe Gladiator offers them a true lifestyle alternative in this popular segment,” said Leslie Ramsoomar, managing director of Stellantis South Africa. <img class="size-full wp-image-598738 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-1.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="587" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-1.jpg 880w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-598740 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-2.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="586" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-2.jpg 880w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-2-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-598742 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-3.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="586" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-3.jpg 880w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gladiator-3-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> For the exterior, Jeep has opted to keep the seven-slot grille seen on Wrangler, but widened the grille slots for additional air intake to assist with the increased towing capacity.

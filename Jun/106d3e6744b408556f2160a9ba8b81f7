Logistics company DHL Express says it will invest in a new world-class service centre facility to be built in Waterfall, Midrand. The greenfield project will be jointly developed by the SOM Group and Waterfall, with an overall project commitment for the next 15 years of around R500 million, the logistics company said in a statement on Friday (3 June). “We are thrilled to announce this investment which truly affirms DHL’s commitment to Africa, and more specifically, South Africa. South Africa is a key market for us and this expansion will ensure that we continue to provide our ever-growing customer base with the best-in-class service quality which they have become accustomed to,” said Jed Michaletos, managing director of DHL Express South Africa. “We have experienced continued growth in inbound and outbound volumes, coupled with the accelerated rise of cross border e-commerce, which has necessitated this move.” Michaletos said the new facility will make use of a drive-in model, maximising productivity and increasing the volume of shipments processed daily to ensure faster delivery of shipments for customers. “The increased capacity will enable us to handle a double-digit increase in shipments processed per hour, and will allow further growth of up to triple digits if required,” he said. The facility will receive, process and transport inbound and outbound shipments to their intended destinations. The development will include an increase in floor space and advancements in technology and processes as well as Material Handling Equipment, which will omit manual handling of shipments and facilitate direct loading of shipments. The construction has commenced on site and completion is scheduled for April 2023. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-593398 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-2-1024x592.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="486" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-2-1024x592.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-2-300x173.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-2-768x444.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-2-1536x887.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-2-2048x1183.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-2-1200x693.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-593400 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-3-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DHL-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: New project to create 30,000 jobs a year in South Africa

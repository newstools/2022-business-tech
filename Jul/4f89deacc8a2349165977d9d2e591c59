With recession fears mounting, and inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the lingering pandemic taking a toll – many tech companies are rethinking their staffing needs, with some of them instituting hiring freezes, rescinding offers and even starting layoffs. Here’s a look at the dozens of companies that are pulling back. Alphabet Inc, Google’s parent company, is decelerating its recruiting efforts. According to an internal memo, chief executive officer Sundar Pichai told employees, that- although the business added 10,000 Googlers in the second quarter -it will be slowing the pace of hiring for the rest of the year and prioritizing engineering and technical talent. “Like all companies, we’re not immune to economic headwinds,” he said. The search giant had nearly 164,000 employees at the end of March. Amazon.com Inc said in April that it was overstaffed after ramping up during the pandemic and needed to cut back. “As the variant subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity,” chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said. Amazon is subleasing some warehouse space and has paused the development of facilities meant for office workers, saying it needs more time to figure out how much space employees will require for hybrid work. The company had 1.6 million workers as of March, making it the biggest employer in the tech world. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-608710" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-e1658294365235.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-e1658294365235.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-e1658294365235-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Apple Inc is planning to slow hiring and spending at some divisions next year to cope with a potential economic slump, according to people familiar with the matter.

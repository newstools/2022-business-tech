Despite a global pandemic and economic and political uncertainty, the demand for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) among business professionals continues to rise. An MBA provides aspiring professionals with a sought-after qualification and can fast-track your career advancement and earning potential. An MBA is the world’s best known and most widely recognised management education qualification, says Regent Business School. “It has become one of the most sought-after qualifications in today’s corporate world as a prerequisite to most top management positions as well as for successful career progression,” it said. The latest Financial Times ranking for Executive Education shows that several business schools in South Africa rank high against their global counterparts. The British-based Henley Business School has a strong presence in South Africa, and ranks 18th on the combined custom ranking of top executive education institutions, while the UCT Graduate School of Business (UCT GSB) also ranks well, and is particularly well-rated for its affordability. UCT GSB ranks 44th in the world and number one in Africa for its customized programmes by the latest Financial Times Ranking. It ranks 15th in the world for growth and features in the top 40 for both programme design and customer relationship management. “Our ability to feature so strongly against the global competition is a phenomenal achievement given the context of the pandemic, economic hardship and major political and social unrest in Kwa-Zulu Natal in 2021,” said Rayner Canning, business development director at the UCT GSB. “We continue to see rapid growth in new client acquisition and strong client retention rates in excess of 75%. These are a direct result of our willingness to collaborate and partner closely, our agility and our high-touch client-centric approach.” BusinessTech looked at some of the leading institutions in the country, and how much it costs to attend them in 2022 (in some cases additional registration or application fees apply): <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-590820" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GIBSUniversityofPretoria-e1653576371521.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /> University of Pretoria’s Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) Tuition fee: R376,848

Cape Town Station is undergoing a complete refurbishment into a mixed-use space primed for student accommodation, led by specialist contractor GVK-Siya Zama. GVK-Siya Zama specialises in building, renovating, restoring and recycling buildings, and recently secured the R1.1 billion Cape Town Station development contract, along with a R900 million hospital construction project in the Eastern Cape. The Cape Town Station refurbishment was commissioned by Eris Property Group, with the aim to redevelop the train station into a mixed-use residential and retail space. “Situated on the corners of Strand, Adderley and Old Marine Drive in the Cape Town CBD, the redevelopment of the Cape Town station is a complex landmark project,” Eben Meyburgh, Group CEO at GVK-Siya Zama said. The redeveloped property will include a 20-storey, 3,085-bed purpose-built student accommodation facility, 6,700 square metres of retail space, and a new world-class public square, he said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-586292" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="974" height="626" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-300x193.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-768x493.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-1536x986.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-2048x1315.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-02-1200x770.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-586294" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="659" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-300x204.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-1024x696.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-768x522.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-1536x1043.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-2048x1391.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-town-station-complete-01-1200x815.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The project forms part of Eris’s RISE Student Living brand – a major student accommodation provider in South Africa.

GVK-Siya Zama said it intends to pursue more projects of this type and has more in the pipeline. Read: Cape Town plans major redevelopment – including more walkable areas

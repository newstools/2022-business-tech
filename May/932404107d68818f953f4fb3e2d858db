Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will be introduced on Monday evening due to a further breakdown of units. “Eskom regrets to inform the public that, due to the breakdown of a generation unit each at Majuba and Medupi power stations today, Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 17h00 until 22h00 tonight. Three generation units are expected to return to service by this evening, which will ramp up through the night.” The power utility said it will continue to closely monitor the system, and adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary. “We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items. We currently have 2,246MW on planned maintenance, while another 15,847MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “Eskom cautions the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks.” Eskom noted that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. “We, therefore, urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially between 05h00 – 09h00 in the mornings and 16h00 – 22h00 in the evenings.”  Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

Andrew Stein is the vice president and managing director of Game – a position he has held since July 2019. He previously worked at Cambridge Food – a division of Massmart/Walmart – for over seven years where he held several positions, including marketing executive and marketing director. Stein then became the marketing and e-commerce director for Makro South Africa in 2017, before taking over as the Game vice president. In this episode of Business Talk, Stein talks host Michael Avery through Game’s recent upgrades to its online shopping experience and brick-and-mortar stores. Stein discusses how Game has evolved to support the new way of shopping online – including the addition of enhanced functionality to the refreshed Game website, which launched in April. He highlights the latest shopping trends that Game has noticed in the South African market, such as the rising popularity of air fryers due to soaring oil prices, and talks about the measures Game has taken over the last few years to overcome supply chain issues and maintain its stock levels for South Africans. Finally, Stein discusses Game’s plans for the future and how it is enhancing its offerings to cater to its customers.

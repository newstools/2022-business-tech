Eskom has announced that it will again implement load shedding on Thursday night during peak demand hours. As was the case since Monday, stage 2 blackouts will hit South Africans between 17h00 and 22h00 on Thursday evening. While a generation unit each at Kusile and Tutuka Power Stations was returned to service overnight, a generating unit at Lethabo Power Station was taken off for repairs, Eskom said. Two more generation units are expected to return to service on Thursday afternoon. 2,379MW are offline for planned maintenance, but 15,365MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. Eskom said the onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. “Unfortunately, this would generally require the implementation of load shedding during the evening peaks,” it said. Eskom urged all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially between 05h00 and 09h00 in the mornings and 16h00 and 22h00 in the evenings.

This offering combines SA Taxi’s competencies in assessing credit risk and providing vehicle finance, and WeBuyCars’ ability to efficiently underwrite and recover on the value of used vehicles. Its business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce capabilities, which were introduced in 2021, now account for approximately 18% of total online sales, up from circa 8% at the end of the 2021 financial year. “WeBuyCars is well-positioned to gain market share through its physical and e-commerce platforms by driving a differentiated customer experience enhanced by AI-led pricing, proprietary data sets and other technology advantages”, said Hurwitz. “We expect future earnings from WeBuyCars to continue to grow at similar rates over the medium-term.” Read: These are the most popular new and used car brands and body types in South Africa

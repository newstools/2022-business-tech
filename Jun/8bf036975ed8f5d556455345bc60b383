Job creation is a crucial yardstick for cities, as employed individuals are the single biggest driver of GDP in each municipality. The South African Cities Network (SACN), through its latest State of Cities Report (SoCR) points to ‘unacceptably high’ unemployment figures in every major metropolitan area. Nelson Mandela Bay currently leads with the highest unemployment rate, followed by Mangaung and Ekurhuleni – meanwhile, the City of Cape Town metro has the lowest unemployment rate. By 2050 the South African urban population is expected to increase by between 19 and 24 million people, joining approximately 68% of the population who already live in cities. Increased urbanisation places additional pressure on already stretched resources and makes it harder to deliver on the Integrated Urban Development Framework’s (IUDF) goals which promote access, growth, governance and spatial transformation, said the South African Cities Network. It said that job creation is undoubtedly the greatest priority for all spheres of government right now as Statistics South Africa data reveals one of the highest unemployment figures in the world. First-quarter data from the stats body shows unemployment at 34.5%, with the expanded definition much higher than that. Danga Mughogho, programme manager of the SACN, highlighted the country’s huge youth unemployment crisis – with the youth unemployment rate remaining at a staggering 66.5%. StatsSA said that the country has over 10 million young people aged 15-24 years and, of these, only 2.5 million were in the labour force, either employed or unemployed. The largest share (7.7 million or 75.1 %) of this group of young people are those that are out of the labour force (i.e. inactive). The main reason for being inactive is discouragement, i.e. they have lost hope of finding a job that suits their skills or in the area they reside. As many as 37% of this group were disengaged from the labour markets. These are regarded as youth not in employment, education or training (NEET). <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-593730" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Statssa-e1654432896821.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="640" /> Of the 40 million working-age population in Q1:2022, more than half (51.6%) were youth – 15-34 years. The current national absorption rate was recorded at 37.3% and remains lower for young people at 9% among those aged 15-24 years. Mughogho said this age group is best positioned to meet key digital skills demands, especially in the IT and data science sectors – where there is a war for talent among the banking and retail sectors, specifically – and that cities can contribute greatly to skills development among our youth, which will go a long way towards eradicating joblessness. The report provides an insightful look at SACN’s nine participating cities, namely Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, City of Ekurhuleni, City of Joburg, City of Tshwane, eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, Msunduzi Local Municipality, Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality as well as Cape Town.

Eskom has announced that stage 3 load shedding will be implemented between 05h00-16h00 on Wednesday and Thursday as it has seen a recovery at some of its units. Stage 4 load shedding will then be implemented on both days between 16h00 and 00h00. “Eskom anticipates lower stages of load shedding to be implemented through the weekend as some units return to service. Should anything change in the intervening period, Eskom will communicate and implement any changes as may be necessary,” the power utility said. “A unit each at Arnot, Camden and Kusile power stations tripped or were taken offline for repairs since last night, while a unit each at Kusile and Kendal power stations were returned to service.” Eskom said it currently has 3,934MW on planned maintenance, while another 14,867MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “As the generation capacity shortages persist over the next few weeks, load shedding will continue to be implemented at various stages. Eskom cautions the public that it will still take a few weeks for the power generation system to recover.” “Eskom would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially during these uncertain times on the power system.” <img class="size-full wp-image-605832 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom.png" alt="" width="633" height="346" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom.png 633w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

The Mpumalanga Lowveld has recorded increasing interest from property buyers countrywide according to Ramona Grimbeeck, principal at Chas Everitt Lowveld. Home to four of the 10 wildlife estates recently named South Africa’s best by New World Wealth, Chas Everitt reports an increase in home purchases in estates close to Nelspruit and White River over the past two years. “While most buyers are local executives and professionals, a significant percentage are people relocating from Gauteng and elsewhere in the country.” Grimbeeck said that people are being encouraged to move by the increasing trend towards remote working, meaning a move away from big cities to run their companies or do their work from home. Luxury estates such as Leopard Creek, Mjejane, Likweti and Elephant Point, which are all on New World Wealth’s Top 10 list, are a big drawcard for high-end buyers keen to own homes in the world-famous wildlife zone close to the Kruger National Park, and to be able to fly in and out via the Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport if necessary, Grimbeeck said. As the capital of Mpumalanga, Nelspruit also houses most of the provincial government offices and employees and also offers a good mix of property types and good value for money. “In addition, the area boasts some very sought-after schools, including Uplands College on the doorstep of the White River Country Estate, Penryn College, White River Primary, Rob Ferreira High, Flamboyant, and King’s College.” Grimbeeck said that the most active price bracket currently is R1.5 million to R2.5 million, while prices for large three-bedroom homes in older upmarket suburbs start at around R1.8 million. Two-bedroom retirement cottages are available for around R1.5 million. “In the most popular estates, three to six-bedroom homes are currently priced at between R3.5 million to R6 million, and there are several guesthouses for sale at prices from R7 million to around R13 million.” Two-bedroom apartments in lifestyle estates in White River are available from around R650,000, and three and four-bedroom family homes in Parkville, close to the schools, from R1.75 million to R2 million, said Grimbeeck. “Upmarket estate homes in White River Country Estate and Likweti Bushveld Farm Estate start at around R3.3 million and range up to around R7.7 million.” 2 bedroom lodge in Matumi, Elephants Point –  R7,290,000 <img class="size-full wp-image-584718 aligncenter"

Transport minister Fikile Mbalula says his department is working on a number of updates for driver licences in South Africa, including the option to have a licence delivered directly to your home or office. In a media briefing on Wednesday (12 January), Mbalula said the Department of Transport also plans to begin accepting online payments for several services, including: Motor vehicle licence renewals;
Driving licence card renewals;
Learner’s licence tests;
Driving licence tests. Mbalula also confirmed that the government is considering a new smart driver licence card for the country, which will be presented to president Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet shortly. This will help address a growing backlog as approximately half a million South African motorists are stuck with expired driving licence cards because the twenty-year-old machine that prints them all has been out of order since November.

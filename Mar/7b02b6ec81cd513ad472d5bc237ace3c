Credit cards catering to the ultra-rich offer insane rewards and lavish perks, with the Centurion Card from American Express seen as perhaps the most desirable piece of plastic. The Amex Black Card, as it is popularly referred has seen many competitors entering the market in recent years, trying to differentiate themselves, whether it be by unique travel rewards, dining experiences, expensive gifts, or having the physical card be made out of a precious metal. These cards are mostly invitation only offerings, depending on your bank balance, and investable assets, and come with hefty initiation, and annual membership fees. Here are the most exclusive credit cards in the world and how much they cost: Centurion Card from American Express <img class="aligncenter wp-image-90012" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AMEX-Centurion.png" alt="AMEX Centurion" width="642" height="428" /> Initiation fee: R153,000 ($10,000)
Annual fee: R76,500 ($5,000)
Minimum spending: upwards of R3,800,000 ($250,000) The Amex Centurion was first introduced in 1999 to meet the special needs of American Express’ biggest spenders. According to Forbes, exclusivity is the main draw of the Amex Centurion, and the air of mystery around the card is reinforced by the fact that someone can only get their hands on it by invitation. “The criteria used to determine if you are worthy for the card are completely unknown; however, if you are not on a first-name basis with your American Express rep, the Amex Centurion is probably not in your wheelhouse,” said Forbes. CreditCardInsider reports that according to online superstition, to get noticed by the invitees, you need to charge between R3,800,000 ($250,000) and R6,800,000 ($450,000) on your standard American Express card. American Express’ most interesting perk for Amex Centurion cardholders is that they can get 50% rebates on airfares purchased with American Membership Rewards points. Other rewards include a 24/7 personal concierge, which can get you tickets to events,  reservations on flights, elite status at Delta Airlines, hotel bookings and car rentals.

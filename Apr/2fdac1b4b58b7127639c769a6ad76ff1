Sean Sanders is the founder and CEO at Revix – an intelligent investment management platform that makes it easy for South Africans to access cryptocurrency investment and trading. Sanders has extensive experience in both tech and finance and is incredibly passionate about how these two industries combine through cryptocurrency. Before founding Revix, he created online university application system Application Portal, event-driven proprietary trading firm Sataya, and crypto-asset advisory firm Blocktree Capital. In this episode of What’s Next, Sanders breaks down one of the most popular topics in the finance industry today: Decentralised Finance (DeFi). After explaining what DeFi is, he discusses whether DeFi can ever truly challenge traditional finance as we know it. Sanders also talks about the investment opportunities offered by DeFi, and explains that it is extremely easy to begin this journey through the Revix platform. This is thanks to Revix’s ready-made cryptocurrency bundles, which are comparable to the JSE Top 40, but for cryptocurrency. Sanders explains why these bundles are the more responsible approach to investing in cryptocurrency. He concludes by explaining Revix’s latest DeFi-focused promotion.

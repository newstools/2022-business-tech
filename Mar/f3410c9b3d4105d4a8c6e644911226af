If your business is looking for an industry-leading security solution that covers all your cloud and on-premise platforms, then IBM Cloud Paks are the answer. IBM Cloud Paks are comprehensive solutions designed to incorporate extensive IBM capabilities across the hybrid cloud at a lower overall cost – and leverage the power of IBM’s Watson AI to perform impressive tasks that neither human IT teams, nor IBM’s competitors, can rival. Fill out the lead gen form at the bottom of the article to learn more. IBM Cloud Paks are built on Red Hat OpenShift, which also makes it easy to develop applications once and deploy them across any cloud platform. They simplify the integration of various IBM and open-source solutions into each other, too, offering superior functionality and efficiency for your business. A standout example of this is IBM Cloud Pak for Security, which is specifically designed to help businesses uncover threats, make informed decisions about risks, and respond faster to malicious actors – all while leaving and securing business data where it is. What makes this offering unique is that with a Cloud Pak, the solution comes pre-packaged, pre-integrated, and built cloud-native to run on any platform for hybrid multi-cloud environments. It is therefore ideal for businesses who want to integrate a range of IBM security solutions – such as QRadar and Guardium – into each other and other third-party security services across various cloud platforms, in their own private cloud, or on-premise. The key benefits of IBM Cloud Pak for Security include: Automate manual processes – Reduce investigation and response time by automating tasks.
Choose where to deploy – Pre-integration with Red Hat OpenShift allows deployment either on the cloud or on-premise.
Increase visibility – Search hybrid multicloud environments and pull insights into a unified console.
Enable flexible growth – Choose and add capabilities using modular security solutions.
Reduce vendor lock-in – Integrate with third-party products and add your own custom connections.

Teraco Data Environments has announced the successful completion of the previously announced agreement by Digital Realty to acquire a majority interest in the company from a consortium of investors, including Berkshire Partners and Permira. Digital Realty is the largest global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data centre, colocation and interconnection solutions. With the acquisition completed, Teraco will be known as Teraco: A Digital Realty Company. The acquisition of Teraco adds South Africa to Digital Realty’s three markets on the continent, including Kenya, Mozambique, and Nigeria. “The strategic importance of these four markets has been enhanced by the recent and ongoing implementation of new subsea cable networks encircling Africa. Combined with Digital Realty’s highly connected facilities, clients now have access to a choice of strategic connectivity and interconnection platforms that serve all corners of the African market,” the group said. As South Africa’s largest and most densely interconnected data centre platform, Teraco supports the rapid growth of the continent’s Internet community through its expanding portfolio of data centres, the group said. Teraco’s experienced management team, growing multi-national client base, quality infrastructure and ownership of NAPAfrica, the continent’s largest Internet Exchange Point, are key differentiators that position the company for sustainable growth. “Africa is poised to remain a high growth, high-demand area for data centre solutions. Our combined, diversified platform will further enable us to support our customers in the pan-Africa region and worldwide,” said Jan Hnizdo, Teraco’s chief executive officer.

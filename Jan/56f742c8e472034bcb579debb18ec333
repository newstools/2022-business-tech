For most homeowners with bonds, the interest rate hike announced by the Reserve Bank on Thursday (27 January) will mean paying extra on their monthly repayments. While economists were largely unanimous on the possibility of a hike ahead of the announcement, the decision to hike the repo rate by 25 basis points to 4% (base home loan rate to 7.5%) is still disappointing says Dr Andrew Golding, chief executive of the Pam Golding Property group. “Following on from November’s repo rate increase, we had hoped that there would be a pause in the upward cycle trend. “However, with the December consumer inflation rate (at 5.9%) close to the upper limit of the Reserve Bank’s inflation target and with local risks to the inflation outlook firmly on the upside – the MPC was likely to take this decision to increase rates now.” Notwithstanding this, the interest rate will hopefully increase slowly and over an extended period of time, Golding said. The decision by the SARB to increase rates was entirely expected and is unlikely to affect the momentum in the property market, added Samuel Seeff, chairman of the Seeff Property Group. Against the backdrop of rising inflation and a higher oil price, Seeff says, while unfair, it is inevitable that the consumer will, unfortunately, have to absorb the higher costs – even though the rising inflation is not a result of higher consumption. Nonetheless, he adds that even with the hikes, the rate remains at the lowest levels in decades and will continue serving as an inducement to buyers. “We expect the market to absorb the hike comfortably and for the momentum to continue. Looking back over the last year, the market has again defied expectation and ended with some of the highest sales in over three years,” he said.

As a BMC partner, Blue Turtle Product Manager Francois Seegers said that one of the biggest strengths of BMC Helix AIOps is that it can consume and process event data from multiple event data consumers across an extensive range of discovery and monitoring sources. AIOps is also equipped to deal with event noise, as it can sift through all your enterprise’s events and determine which are the most important. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-595570 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BMC-HelicAIOps.png" alt="" width="640" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BMC-HelicAIOps.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BMC-HelicAIOps-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Once you have processed the data from these important events, your AIOps solution generates valuable insights that can help you make informed operational decisions and also trigger hyperautomation activities to auto remediate problems. BMC’s Helix AIOps can even be programmed to automatically perform certain intelligent automation actions if a variety of parameters are met – such as triggers a policy-driven pop-up with a recommendation for a quick, automated action leveraging TrueSight Orchestration, TrueSight Automation for Servers, and Ansible, with more solutions coming in the near future. One of the biggest selling points of BMC’s Helix AIOps over its competitors is that it works seamlessly across all major cloud providers, and can be used in multi and hybrid cloud scenarios. “If there’s a customer who is using a private cloud, BMC Helix AIOps can connect to these platforms – including all the dominant players like AWS and Google Cloud,” said Seegers. BMC’s Helix AIOps also works seamlessly with other BMC solutions in the cloud, which allows you to combine these tools helps improve service performance, availability, and customer experiences while simultaneously improving efficiency and lowering costs. It enables ITOM/ITSM teams to shift their attention from maintenance to more strategic tasks and innovations that deliver a competitive advantage. Seegers said that because BMC’s Helix AIOps is designed to work across so many data sources, and because the solutions are so powerful thanks to their use of ML and AI, your business saves significant time providing significant value to your business. “You don’t need your employees to sit in front of a screen trying to interpret all this evet data – the solution is doing that for you,” said Seegers. “Your staff are free to focus on innovation within your business and learn and develop new skills.” “BMC’s Seth Paskin: It should be noted that an acknowledgement that ITOps management is exceeding human scale does not mean that the machines are replacing humans. It means we need big data, AI/ML, and automation to deal with the new reality. Humans aren’t replaced, but ITOps personnel will need to develop new skills. New roles will emerge.” If you’re interested in integrating BMC Helix AIOps into your business, Blue Turtle is the obvious choice to help you through this process.

The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has warned road users on the city’s M2 motorway that travel will be interrupted by road construction over the next month. The city is in the process of road resurfacing on both sides of the highway, which will take place between 09h00 and 15h00 on weekdays. The specific areas affected are: Eastbound at the Cleveland on and off-ramps and
Westbound between New Goch Rd and the Maritzburg off-ramp <img class="aligncenter wp-image-585952" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Road-works-ahead.png" alt="" width="999" height="454" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Road-works-ahead.png 1628w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Road-works-ahead-300x136.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Road-works-ahead-1024x465.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Road-works-ahead-768x349.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Road-works-ahead-1536x698.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Road-works-ahead-1200x545.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “Sectional road closures will be implemented on the shoulder lanes and slow lanes on both the aforementioned directions on the motorway during roadworks. All other road lanes will be open to traffic,” it said. The resurfacing project is anticipated to be completed by the 30th of June 2022. “Motorists are urged to exercise caution and patience when approaching the roadworks sites to ensure their safety and that of the road workers. The JRA apologises for any inconveniences caused and thanks road users in advance for their patience throughout the duration of the project.” The resurfacing forms part of the JRA’s R12 million commitment to upgrade the M2 motorway, which will include repairing pavements, sealing cracks, overlaying asphalt, and repainting road markings in the affected areas. By the end of the project, almost six kilometres of road will have been upgraded, the JRA said. Read: One of South Africa’s major routes is getting an upgrade

With an average collection time of just 3 minutes, these ‘little robot helpers’ guarantee safe transport of packages from behind the scene to shoppers’ hands – another first for AGV WEASEL® which have only been used in non-customer facing areas across the world. With the support of AGVs, Takealot staff are able to offer an even quicker, yet still personal collection experience. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-347064 size-full" src="https://test.businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Weasels-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /> Takealot is a proudly South African company, with a footprint that touches every corner of the country. In celebration of its local heritage, Takealot has commissioned local Afro-centric Avant-Garde artist, Silas Motse for a large-scale bespoke art installation that showcases the Western Cape’s indigenous fynbos flora and the sustainable lifecycle of the iconic Takealot box. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-347066 size-full" src="https://test.businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Richmond-Park-Artwork.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /> As of May 2022, all Takealot boxes will also carry the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) accreditation logo. The FSC is an international non-profit, multi-stakeholder organisation established in 1993 that promotes the responsible management and care of our forests around the world. As a highly trusted and respected organisation, the FSC badge stamp highlights the origins of the materials used. The stamp also denotes the independent third-party confirmation that the packaging adheres to the FSC’s social and environmental standards underpinned by global best-practice. More importantly, the stamp is proof that all packaging is made from 100% recycled materials – helping to alleviate pressure on the forests across the world and supporting Takealot’s commitment to sustainable packaging. The new Takealot Pickup Point can be found at 1A Hansen Close, Richmond Park, Cape Town, and officially opened its doors on 1 April 2022. Expect more exciting sustainability and social upliftment initiatives coming from South Africa’s leading online retailer in the near future.

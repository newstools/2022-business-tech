Statistics South Africa has published its latest consumer price index, showing that annual headline inflation quickened to 5,9% in March from 5,7% in February. This places it just below the upper limit (6%) of the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB’s) monetary policy target range. The biggest culprit was fuel prices which increased by 7.2% between February and March, with inland 95-octane petrol rising by R1.46 per litre to reach a record high of R21.60 per litre. Fuel prices have risen by an eye-watering 33.2% in the twelve months to March, with petrol prices climbing by 32.6% and diesel by 35.1%, the statistics body said. The transport index in March was also driven higher by increases in toll fees, air transport and bus fares. Some of the largest annual price increases (March 2021 vs March  2022) were recorded for the following goods and services: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-578946 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CPI-1024x688.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="564" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CPI-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CPI-300x201.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CPI-768x516.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CPI-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CPI.jpg 1306w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Food and groceries Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation was softer in March.

Power utility Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented on Sunday evening – with stage 3 load shedding to follow on Monday and Tuesday next week. Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented on Sunday night from 17h00 to 22h00. Stage 3 load shedding will be implemented at the same times on Monday and Tuesday – thereafter stage 2 load shedding will be in effect during those times for the rest of the week. Any changes to these times will be communicated. The power utility said that load shedding is necessary due to further breakdowns in generating capacity, with losses due to unplanned outages sitting over 17,500MW. It previously warned that the national grid is under major strain due to the colder weather and demand on the system during peak hours. Consumers are encouraged to reduce demand by turning off non-essential appliances and reduce usage during peak hours – 05h00 to 09h00 in the mornings, and 16h00 to 22h00 in the evenings.

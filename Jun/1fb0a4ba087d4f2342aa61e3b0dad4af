Data from the latest Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2022 shows what it takes for cities to compete in the race to the top as destinations for startup talent and investment. The findings show that Silicon Valley is the top global startup ecosystem, followed by New York City and London tied at second. North America continues to dominate the Global Rankings, with 47% of the top 30 ecosystems in this region. The GSER is the world’s most comprehensive, data-driven research on startups with 280+ entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems and 3 million startups analyzed. The report includes a ranking of the leading 140 ecosystems, and is published by  innovation policy advisory and research firm Startup Genome, and the Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) “Today, the digital economy is the economy — or at least the economy’s future,” the report’s authors said. The World Economic Forum estimates that 70% of new value created globally over the next 10 years will be based on digital business models. In 2023, for the first time, more than half of GDP will be driven by “digitally transformed” enterprises, according to Statista. PWC projects that gain from AI alone will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Despite the early shadow it cast on startups, Covid-19 ultimately boosted the sector by accelerating digitization, said Startup Genome. Since the pandemic, tech companies grew 2.3 times more than their non-tech counterparts. While about 90% of startups completely fail, Startup Genome research demonstrates that only 1.5% of startups — or about 15% of those that survive — produce a successful exit of $50 million or more across the top eight US startup ecosystems. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-597614" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/StartupTechCompanies.png" alt="" width="1013" height="542" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/StartupTechCompanies.png 1013w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/StartupTechCompanies-300x161.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/StartupTechCompanies-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Since 2012, global average Series A rounds have tripled to more than $18 million. Post-money valuations are up, on average, by 239% over 10 years, with the biggest growth in later rounds. Deep Tech As for major innovation trends, the rising digits tell the story: Web3, Industry 5.0, Supply Chain 4.0. And, of course, 5G. Innovations in — among many other sectors — digital finance, AI-discovered molecules, and climate-change mitigation are remaking not just business, but also the social and physical worlds. Talent And just as two decades ago Silicon Valley reinvented the culture of place with open offices and spaces optimized for collaboration, so today’s startups are leading our new culture of placeless-ness, said Startup Genome. “In the Covid-19 pandemic, tech companies both facilitated and pioneered new ways of working, including the virtual-first model, popularized by companies including Dropbox, which makes remote the default. Investment is also no longer tied to location, with some venture capitalists using Zoom to perform due diligence on far-flung investments, geographically expanding their reach.” However, by rendering talent and capital more fluid, the report’s authors said that technology has paradoxically made geography more important than ever. “Now that founders, talent, and investors can be anywhere, polestars like Silicon Valley, London, and Beijing must compete with hundreds of expanding constellations, each with its own legal, economic, and lifestyle advantages.” India Rising The startup landscape has shifted substantially, with India surging close behind the United States and China, the report showed. The country has seen a rapid rise in the number of large exits and early-stage rounds, and a substantial increase in Ecosystem Value. India minted 44 unicorns in 2021, raised a total of $72 billion in exits (up from $1.8 billion in 2020). Hot Spots Everywhere India and China may be the big stories of 2021, but dozens of other intriguing narratives proliferated around the globe, said Startup Genome. Continuing a trend of declining funding share that began in 2016, North America accounted for less than half of early-stage funding in 2021, with Europe and Asia both taking a bite of the total. VC activity in Latin America nearly doubled from the previous year. A record 540 companies achieved unicorn status in 2021, with 113 ecosystems producing at least one billion-dollar-plus behemoth. Twenty-two ecosystems — including Brisbane, Luxembourg, Santiago-Valparaiso, and Ho Chi Minh City — achieved their first unicorns in the period examined for the GSER. The GSER 2022 ranks startup ecosystems on seven success factors, including performance and talent, and for South Africa, the report highlighted Cape Town and Johannesburg.

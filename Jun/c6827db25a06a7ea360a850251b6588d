Over 900 users were online on The Carrington’s launch website as the sales went live at midday, ensuring a record launch for the developers who have built a foundation of quality workmanship and excellent service to produce more than fifty successful developments in South Africa. Rawson Developers is well-known for its innovation in the property arena, including its brand-new development The Tokyo just 100m from The Carrington, which took Cape Town by storm and sold over 90 percent of the 148 units in the first two hours after opening up sales in March last year. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-347308 size-full" src="https://test.businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Carrington1.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" /> An opportunity to invest in this sought-after development was also available through the EasyProperties platform. Interested investors could own a piece of The Carrington from as little as R1. The Carrington was extremely popular in the fractional ownership model, that the investment consisting of one floor of apartments through EasyProperties is currently fully funded. “The success of The Carrington’s launch highlights the demand and longevity of the Cape Town property market, considering the tough economic conditions both in South Africa and globally,” says Möller. And Cape Town’s viability as a live-work-play destination continues to grow. The city was recently named the World’s third greatest City by the UK’s Telegraph newspaper – yet another of the many accolades the city holds for its grand beauty, vibrant city culture and close proximity to top education institutions, co-working spaces and outstanding attractions like the Cape Winelands. A number of private-sector partnerships are steering it towards economic recovery and growth, including a push for a special visa for remote working digital nomads in the pipeline. Möller believes that Rawson Developers have formulated a winning recipe for creating the perfect properties for investment, and the developer is planning to launch additional well-priced, conveniently located, premium developments within the year beginning, excitingly with their first Sea Point project which promises to be spectacular.

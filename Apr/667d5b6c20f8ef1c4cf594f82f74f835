Pam Golding, the real estate agent, has put on a show a ‘unique historical property’ on Palmboom Road, in Newlands Cape Town. Dating back to 1857, the property was first intended as a church to serve the community, however, the community soon outgrew the space ultimately resulting in a new church being built on Kildare Road, Pam Golding said. “A national monument with soaring cathedral ceilings, arched windows, an “altar” and 2 mezzanine levels, the property offers a couple of possibilities: convert the chapel into a unique and special home or continue using the space to run a business with municipal consent, the real estate agent said. The accommodation consists of a large open-plan living area, a mezzanine bedroom with Bic, a shower bathroom and guest cloakroom, a study, a modern kitchen and a wine cellar, said Pam Golding. It also noted a vine-covered patio and a walled north-facing garden, and parking for 4/6 cars behind gates. Features: Main bedroom with air conditioner, built-in cupboards and wooden floors

Station House, a unique, mixed-use development on Cape Town’s Atlantic Seaboard, is nearing completion and will feature a boutique signature Pick n Pay supermarket. Located at 19 Kloof Road in the heart of Sea Point, the development features 201 luxury apartments, of which 44 suites form part of the on-site boutique hotel. Apartments comprise studios, one-bed, two-bed, three-bed, and penthouse units. The 12-storey Station House will also feature restaurants by the Kove Collection at street front and the 9th-floor levels, a private residents lounge, braai areas, kinetic gym and pet park, a residents pool, a laundry, a waterless car wash, and pods which include yoga, gym facilities, and a co-working area. Lesley Rensburg, Dogon Group Properties sales agent, said that due to demand, only 61 are still available to purchase. Available apartments at Station House range from studio’s starting at R1.875 million, one-bedroom units from R2.595 million, and two-bedroom units from R5.295 million. There is only one three-bedroom apartment left, which is on the market for R8.85 million. The 44-room boutique hotel at Station House, situated on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors of the building, offers investors an alternative property asset option within the Atlantic Seaboard, and there has been healthy demand for these units – with only 16 still available to purchase. Prices start at R2.765 million and include a basement parking, a furniture package and a storage unit. “Hotel investors will receive an 8% estimated annual return, with a guarantee of up to 4% of the estimated return on the purchase price – ex-VAT and price of the furniture package – for three years,” said Robin Magid, founder and director of D2E Properties. “Investors get to enjoy 14 free off-peak nights per year at the Station House boutique hotel, as well as access to an array of diverse amenities within the building, and an additional seven nights at one of the other hotel destinations within the chain.” Work on Station House is expected to be fully complete by November 2022, with the Pick n Pay grand opening on 25 August 2022, the ground floor restaurant, Sonny & Irene, is set to open its doors from 01 September 2022, and the Rooftop Restaurant, No. 9, will open from 01 October 2022. Pick n Pay recently announced its intention to target three specific income groups in South Africa, including the more luxury segment. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-612673"

Standard Bank Group says that its chief engineering officer has resigned with immediate effect following a series of system outages in recent months. “Over the past two months, the Standard Bank Group has had a series of system outages with a negative impact on our clients and our employees. “Since the major outage on 21 May 2022, our priority has been to stabilise our systems, ensure that services to our clients are fully restored, investigate and remove the causes of these outages, and demonstrate to our clients and colleagues that we are moving quickly and decisively to rebuild confidence in our systems,” the group said in a statement on Friday (3 June). The group’s chief engineering officer, Alpheus Mangale, as the senior executive accountable for the stability of our IT systems, has resigned from the group with immediate effect, it said. The engineering team will now report to Margaret Nienaber, the group’s chief executive for client solutions, adding to her current portfolio, the country’s largest lender said. Nienaber, it said, has wide and deep executive experience in all aspects of financial services. Mangale served as chief information officer between 2017 and 2020, before his appointment to the lead engineering role at the bank. He previously served as an enterprise officer at MTN, and as managing director of Cisco South Africa. Read: 3 big changes FNB customers can expect in the next few months – including eBucks

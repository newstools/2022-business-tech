The vaccine is administered in two doses by intramuscular injection at an interval of two to four weeks, the regulator said on a statement on Monday morning (7 February). Sahpra said final authorisation is subject to a number of conditions, which includes that the vaccine is supplied and administered in accordance with the National Covid-19 vaccination programme.

The Public Servants Association (PSA) has informed the South African Revenue Service (SARS) of its intention to strike. The strike notice follows failed wage negotiations where the parties deadlocked and could not conclude the wage agreement for 2022/2023. SARS maintained the offer of a 0% salary increase throughout the process which was rejected by labour as the price for basic services, food, fuel and electricity are continuously increasing thus have bearing on the affordability for the employees. “The government unashamedly offered 0% salary increase despite pronouncing that tax revenue collections target was exceeded by 25% during the 2020/2021 financial year. The good performance of SARS can only be attributed to the dedication and hard work by the SARS employees hence it defies logic how the same employees could be rewarded with no salary increase,” the PSA said. SARS exceeded its revenue target by over R16 billion rand, the union said. Despite this, it noted that the morale of the workers at SARS is at an all-time low as the revenue service has over the last three years unilaterally removed or altered employees’ benefits. Unions are required by law to provide SARS with seven days’ notice before any strike can commence. “The PSA urges the Minister of Finance to intervene on an urgent basis and ensure that this impasse is resolved to avoid a shutdown of services at the SARS, which will also affect the country’s border posts. “The PSA remains committed to engaging should the SARS place an offer on the table. Despite this, the PSA is ready to pursue the interests and rights of SARS employees at all costs.” PSA represents more than 235,000 public sector employees. SARS employs 12,435 permanent and contract staff. Read: The legal case showing why SARS is increasing its focus on these taxpayers

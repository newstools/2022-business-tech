Eskom has announced stage 2 load shedding will be introduced on Monday evening (9 May). The embattled power utility said the power outage will continue from 17h00 to 22h00 as the power system is severely constrained. It did not provide further information about the state of the system. However, Eskom warned earlier in the day that load shedding might need to be introduced at short notice. Currently, the power utility has 3,049MW offline on planned maintenance and 14,985MW of capacity unavailable due to breakdowns. “While the power system has recovered sufficiently to fully meet the demand during the day, Eskom would like to caution the public that load-shedding might be required at short notice during the evening peaks should there be further breakdowns in currently available capacity,” Eskom said. The power utility added that it expects to return a generation unit each at the Kusile and Kendal power stations before the evening peak on Monday.

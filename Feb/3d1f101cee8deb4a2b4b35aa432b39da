Organisations are moving their information management systems and processes to the cloud to extract a better total cost of ownership (TCO). They have realised that these solutions offer extensive business benefits – including improved flexibility and greater savings. To help your business take advantage of these benefits, OpenText has partnered with Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud to help you build cloud solutions that suit your organisation’s specific needs. Both Microsoft Azure and AWS have data centres located within South Africa, which alleviates any concerns your business may have regarding data sovereignty and residency. Find out how much money you could save with OpenText Cloud. Additionally, OpenText’s strategic approach to cloud deployment gives you full control of how your information management systems are designed so that you can easily customise these solutions and integrate them across the business. Implementation times are significantly shorter than for on-premise projects, too, thanks to OpenText’s highly-qualified team of IT experts – who save their clients 1-2 months implementation time on average through their cloud-based approach. This cloud-based solution also offers superior security as it is built by OpenText’s experienced and qualified technical staff, who always prioritise best practices to ensure your important business data is protected. There are several reasons that OpenText Cloud is much more affordable than an on-premise solution. Firstly, on-premise equipment requires regular maintenance and this cost can pile up very quickly. Cloud solutions do not require you to make any significant equipment investment, which means you have no equipment maintenance costs. The cost of application upgrades and patching is also removed from cloud-based solutions, as these processes happen automatically in the cloud. Additionally, cloud solutions are incredibly flexible – particularly when it comes to only paying for the resources you need. With on-premise solutions, you must buy enough hardware to cope with your highest peaks – meaning lots of this hardware that you have paid for will not provide value on a consistent basis. Finally, cloud solutions convert traditional capital costs into operational expenses. This offers more flexibility and covers any costs that would not have been considered in an on-premise deployment. Find out how much money you could save with OpenText Cloud.

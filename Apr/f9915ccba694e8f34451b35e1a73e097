Leading cutting tools specialist AM.CO.ZA has launched its new toolings.co.za range, starting with a variety of CNC router bits. AM.CO.ZA offers router bits for cutting multiple materials, including plastics, softwoods, and hardwood boards. Additionally, it can provide you with various CNC router machines.

This, in turn, decreases costs, increases productivity and lowers the risk of factory floor injuries. AM.CO.ZA offers six standard bits that meet the needs of most users and are suitable for commonly-used materials, including: Plastics and acrylics (such as ABS acrylic, Perspex, Plexiglas, and HDPE)
Softwoods and composites (such as Medium Density Fibreboard and SupaWood)
Hardwood and laminates (such as plywood and hardboard). Its straight flute bits are used primarily for wood, while its spiral cut flutes, which are available with single, double, and triple flutes, are generally more suited to plastics and softer woods. EG1 – Straight cut single flute for wood
EG2 – Straight cut double flute for timber, laminates, and melamine-coated chipboard ES1 – Spiral single-flute bit with flat top for hardwoods and plastics
ES2 – Spiral double-flute bit with flat top for harder woods and plastics
ES3 – Spiral three-flute bit with flat top for softwoods and plastics
EB2 – Spiral double-flute bit with ball nose for wood, boards, and plastics (used for smooth cutting, contouring, and fine detail) <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-578776" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Am.co_.za-Image-1_.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Am.co_.za-Image-1_.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Am.co_.za-Image-1_-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> There are also many variations of each type of bit. For example, the EG1 can be ordered with the following range of measurements: Stepdown thickness: 1 – 50mm
Cutting diameter: 1 – 6mm
Shank diameter: 3 – 6mm
Cutting length: 3 – 52mm
Shank length: 20 – 35mm
Overall length: 38 – 80mm AM.CO.ZA’s tooling products have been curated, sourced, and tested with AM.CO.ZA’s EasyRoute CNC System in mind, but its router bits can be used on most reputable CNC routers.  You can order your router bits online through the Buythis store with free shipping, or directly from an AM.CO.ZA branch.

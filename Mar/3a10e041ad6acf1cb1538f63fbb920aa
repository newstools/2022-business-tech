The City of Johannesburg says several licensing centres across the city have been forced to close their doors and stop operations due to ongoing protest action. The city said the protests have flared up due to recent changes made by the Gauteng Provincial Government to driver’s license and testing booking system which blocks third parties from booking services on behalf of individuals or groups. “The City of Johannesburg Licensing Department and Testing stations have been affected by this protest. This is despite the decision to change the booking system being a directive by the Gauteng Provincial Government. The province-wide protest action is an attempt by the affected groups of runners and individuals who benefited from the previous practice to get the Gauteng Provincial Government to heed to their demands. The City’s licensing department has unfortunately also fallen victim to the unrest, and centres have therefore been forced to stop operations.” The closure of our offices and operations has been taken in the interest of preserving the lives of employees and members of the public and to protect property, the city said. The city said the following licensing centres will be closed until further notice: Midrand Licensing Department
Strijdom Park Testing Station
Roodepoort City Hall
Langlaagte Licensing Department
Ormonde Licensing Department
Eureka house

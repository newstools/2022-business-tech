Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: State of emergency: The ANC is mulling over whether to declare a state of emergency on Eskom and the energy sector in the country. While it is not immediately clear what a state of emergency would entail, the ruling party is expected to flesh out the details further in a meeting today. [TimesLive] Close to collapse: Former post office chief executive Mark Barnes has warned that South Africa is dangerously close to collapse and will need to rely on the country’s top private sector minds to pull it out of trouble. Barnes has called on president Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint South Africa’s ‘top 100 people’ to address the country’s issues and has called for a state of emergency to keep things from falling apart [News24] Petrol problems: Government is facing renewed calls to review South Africa’s petrol price as the country faces another record increase on Wednesday. While the government has offered some relief by scrapping R1.50/litre through the fuel levy for the last three months, 75 cents is set to be added back into the petrol price from Tuesday. [EWN] Electric push: Experts have warned that South Africa’s motoring industry risks fading into obscurity as the rest of the world moves electric.  With the exception of Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, which produce limited numbers of electric vehicles, the South African motor industry is geared to the production of vehicles with petrol- and diesel-driven internal combustion engines. [BusinessDay] Markets: South Africa’s rand was flat against the dollar on Monday, helped by a quiet trading session amid a holiday in the United States, while stocks rose on higher oil prices as worries over tight supply outweighed recession fears. The rand is currently trading at R16.33/$, R17.05/€ and R19.79/£. [Reuters]

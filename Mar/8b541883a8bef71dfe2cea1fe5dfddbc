Land Rover has announced pricing for the new Range Rover which will be officially launched in South Africa midway through 2022. The fifth-generation Range Rover will be available with four, five or seven-seat interiors together with Standard and Long Wheelbase body designs. The new luxury SUV will come in a choice of HSE, Autobiography and flagship SV trim levels, while a unique First Edition will be sold throughout the first year of production. The First Edition is based on the Autobiography and will be available exclusively in a Sunset Gold Satin finish, among a choice of five other exterior colours. Three powertrain options will include advanced six- and eight-cylinder engines, including a new Extended Range Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). The New Range Rover is the first Land Rover to be powered by a new 4.4-litre V8 engine, badged P530 in reference to its output in horsepower. This engine produces 390kW and 750Nm of torque, and powers the SUV from 0-100km/h in 4.6 seconds with Dynamic Launch engaged, and to a top speed of 250km/h. A powerful D350 3.0-litre straight-six turbodiesel produces 257kW and 700Nm of torque, and propels the New Range Rover from 0-100km/h in 6.1s. Land Rover said that the new Extended Range P510e PHEV combines the inherent refinement of Land Rover’s 375kW in-line six-cylinder Ingenium petrol engine, with a 38.2kWh lithium-ion battery and a 105kW electric motor integrated with the transmission. Together, the powertrain provides up to 113km of near-silent pure-electric driving and with instantaneous electric torque the new P510e accelerates from 0-100km/h in 5.6s, it said. All Land Rover vehicles come with standard 5-year/100,000km Land Rover Care Warranty and Maintenance Plans. pricing below: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563582" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover6.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="671" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover6.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover6-300x201.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover6-768x515.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563572" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover3-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563578" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover1-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563570" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover4-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563576" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563574" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RangeRover2-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: ‘Hey Mercedes’ how much does the new C-Class cost?

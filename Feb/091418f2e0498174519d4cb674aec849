Eskom has announced that Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 21h00 on Monday (7 February) until 05h00 on Tuesday (8 February). The reintroduction of power cuts is to replenish necessary energy reserves, the power utility said. It warned that further breakdowns could lead to load shedding being extended beyond Tuesday morning. “Since midnight we have lost a unit each at Camden, Kusile, Duvha and Matla power stations. Furthermore, the return of a unit at Kusile and two units at Majuba power stations are delayed. “Total breakdowns amount to 16,261MW while planned maintenance is 5,350MW of capacity as we continue with the reliability maintenance.”  Eskom has warned in a summer load shedding forecast for 2021/2022, that its system is likely to remain severely constrained for the near future.

Chemicals company Sasol has launched a new customer rewards programme which it says will offer savings on fuel purchases and other benefits. Called Sasol Rewards, the programme will let customers earn points from fuel purchases that can be easily redeemed against fuel and in-store purchases at any participating retail convenience centres. “Our Sasol Rewards offering is just the beginning as we are also working towards delivering modernised stores, further leveraging our strategic retail convenience centres supply partnerships to improve our in-store offerings. “We are ambitiously planning on expanding our retail convenience centres to serve more customers in high growth areas,” said Palesa Mokaba, vice president of marketing for Sasol’s Energy Business. How the rewards scheme works Sasol Rewards cards can be obtained from any participating Sasol retail convenience centre countrywide.

As part of the launch period (14 April – 30 June 2022), customers will be awarded 30 points (30 cents) for every litre of fuel purchased at a participating Sasol. While Sasol has not directly specified what the earning rate will be beyond this date, the terms and conditions indicate that 1 point = 1 cent, and that motorists will typically earn 15 points per litre of fuel. No points are issued for convenience store purchases. You can find out more about how the points system works and what products are eligible here. Read: Here is the expected petrol price for May

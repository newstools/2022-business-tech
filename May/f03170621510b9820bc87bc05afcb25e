The City of Cape Town has announced that parts of the metro can expect outages over the coming week as it conducts routine maintenance on its electrical infrastructure. The city said that downtime is necessary to ensure reliable electricity supply and good management of its public infrastructure. “We encourage residents to always double-check on the city’s social media channels to see if their area will be affected by the regular electricity maintenance during the week. “Where customers are affected by supply interruptions due to normal maintenance, they should receive a door-to-door notice ahead of the planned work.” Where possible, the city has asked residents to switch off appliances at the wall socket ahead of the maintenance to reduce the risk of damage caused by power surges. It added that supply could be restored at any time, therefore residents should remember to treat all electrical installations as live for the full duration of the interruption. The full list of affected areas and times can be found below and on the city’s website here. <img class="size-full wp-image-582130 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-Town-outages.png" alt="" width="828" height="863" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-Town-outages.png 828w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-Town-outages-288x300.png 288w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cape-Town-outages-768x800.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Soweto residents want R500 flat rate for electricity

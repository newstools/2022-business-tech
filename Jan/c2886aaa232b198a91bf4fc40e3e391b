Threat to democracy: The ANC’s deepening divisions and factionalism remain the biggest threat to the party and the country’s democratic gains, warn the party’s top leaders. In his closing address at the ANC’s NEC Lekgotla this weekend, president Ramaphosa cited a loss of ‘moral and ethical principles’ within the party’s movement. [News24] Grant: The ANC has called for the extension of the R350 Covid-19 grant introduced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Ramaphosa said that this grant has had a significant positive impact on the lives of the poor, and government must examine the feasibility and affordability of extending it. [SABC] Electricity hikes: Eskom’s chief financial officer Calib Cassim has warned that the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) will need to increase electricity tariffs by 20.5%, because any shortfalls in revenue generation still have to be covered by the government as a major shareholder – and ultimately taxpayers. [IOL] Reserve Bank mandate: The South African Communist Party has called for the South African Reserve Bank’s mandate to be expanded to include job creation. In 2019, suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said the NEC Lekgotla had resolved to expand the central bank’s mandate. However, former finance minister Tito Mboweni dismissed this as a mere discussion without an outcome.

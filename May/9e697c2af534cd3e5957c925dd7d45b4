Executive mayor of Johannesburg, Mpho Phalatse says that one of the oldest suburbs in the city is set for a R240 million facelift, including a multipurpose centre and an urban farm. The project is being managed by the Johannesburg Development Agency, with the project manager noting that the appointment value for phase one will be R35 million. “Bertrams is one of the oldest suburbs in our city and will soon boast a shiny new facility offering all the city’s social development products and services to the people of Region F. The skills centre has been serving the community for many years, with sewing, cooking, baking and early childhood development, among other offerings,” said Phalatse. The executive mayor, acting in her then capacity as the MMC for Health and Social Development, had condemned the building in 2018, leading to the facility standing unoccupied since then. The new centre will include smart libraries, community halls and various community spaces for both the youth and senior citizens. It will also include a bakery and the return of urban farming, said the mayor. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-591764" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams-1.png" alt="" width="1051" height="721" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams-1.png 1051w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams-1-300x206.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams-1-1024x702.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams-1-768x527.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The project has been broken down into two phases, with the first taking place after the soil turning – late last week – and is focused on demolition and earthworks. This is expected to run until the end of October 2022. Phase two is set to begin on 1 November 2022, with the entire R240 million project expected to be completed by 30 June 2023.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-591750" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams.png" alt="" width="992" height="610" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams.png 992w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams-300x184.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bertrams-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: The cars being targeted by hijackers in South Africa right now

BusinessTech’s 2022 Readership Survey has revealed which mobile networks BusinessTech readers use for their smartphones – and which networks they are thinking of moving to. BusinessTech is the largest business publication in South Africa – read by C-level executives, business owners, company directors, managers, and professionals every day. The 2022 Readership Survey was conducted in July, and was completed by 2,684 BusinessTech readers. 93% of these readers are a purchasing decision maker or influencer in their household, providing excellent insight into what South African consumers think of the country’s top brands. Looking at the Mobile Networks section of the survey, Vodacom is the most popular network among BusinessTech readers. It is followed by MTN in second, and Telkom in third. The graph below shows the results of the question: Which mobile network do you use for your smartphone? <img class="aligncenter wp-image-608290" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks.png" alt="" width="640" height="337" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks.png 2164w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks-300x158.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks-1024x538.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks-768x404.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks-1536x808.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks-2048x1077.png 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mobile-Networks-1200x631.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Readers were then asked if they were thinking of moving to a different mobile network.

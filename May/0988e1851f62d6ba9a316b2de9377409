Power utility Eskom says that it will again implement load shedding on Wednesday night due to a shortage of generation capacity during the evening peak. Power cuts will be implemented from 17h00 until 22h00, as has been the case for the last two nights. “This morning two generation units at Hendrina Power Station and one at Matimba Power Station were taken offline for repairs. One generation unit at Arnot Power Station was returned to service. A generation unit each at Kusile and Tutuka power stations is expected to return to service this afternoon,” the group said. The group currently has 2,329MW on planned maintenance, while another 15,988MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “The onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. Unfortunately, this would generally require the implementation of load shedding during the evening peaks. Eskom urged all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially between 05h00 and 09h00 in the mornings and 16h00 and 22h00 in the evenings.

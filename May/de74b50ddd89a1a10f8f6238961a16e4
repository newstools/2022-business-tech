Land Rover says that its new Range Rover Sport will be introduced in South Africa towards the end of 2022. The third-generation model sports an updated chassis and exterior design which the carmaker said boasts “refinement and sophistication”. “A suite of powerful and efficient powertrains includes a six-cylinder extended range electric hybrid, a new V8 and a six-cylinder petrol and diesel engines,” noted Land Rover. The maker of luxury SUVs said that a pure-electric version will be announced in 2024 as it continues to move towards electric powertrains. The new vehicle is available in S, SE, HSE and Autobiography specifications, with a First Edition available throughout the first year of production with a specially curated specification. The flagship V8 Twin Turbo configuration produces 390kW of power and is capable of accelerating from 0-100km/h in 4.5 seconds with dynamic launch engaged. According to Land Rover, the new P510e hybrid Range Rover Sport gets you a range-extender, plug-in hybrid powertrain consisting of a 3.0-litre, a turbo-petrol engine and a 105kW electric motor, producing 375kW. It also offers drivers over 100km of zero-emissions. When driving fully electric in the hybrid, the new model has an expected real-world range of 88km – enough for most owners to complete up to 75% of their trips on electric power – and CO2 emissions of 18g/km, Land Rover said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585326" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-Header-1024x625-1-e1652252501801.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="610" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585324" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-Header-1-1024x625-1-e1652252491773.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="610" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585322" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-7-1024x602-1-e1652252486116.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="588" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585332" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-2-1024x699-1-e1652252598591.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-585320" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-24-1024x680-1.jpg" alt="" width="1003" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-24-1024x680-1.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-24-1024x680-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Range-Rover-Sport-24-1024x680-1-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: New driving licence to be introduced in South Africa – with plans to use ‘the blockchain’

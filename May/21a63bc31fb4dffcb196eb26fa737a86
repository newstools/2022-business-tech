South Africa’s favourite online retailer takealot.com is officially turning 11 – celebrating this milestone and entry into its second decade by saying Thanksalot to loyal customers from 23 May to 5 June 2022. It’s been quite a journey for the company, having started out in a small suburban home with stock stacked on shelves in the garage as the brand entered the South African e-commerce market.

Across the Takealot Group there are over 5,500 direct employees, and a further 600 through various franchise operations. “When you look back at the Takealot journey, it’s a true showcase of the proudly South African ‘can do’ spirit that fills our country,” says Frederik Zietsman, Chief Executive Officer of takealot.com. “What started as a new and exciting way for South Africans to browse and shop for their favourite DVDs, books, and electronics has turned into a platform that over three million people rely on to source everything they could possibly want in the palm of their hands.” As part of this 11-year journey, the company is proud of the positive impact it has been able to have by creating jobs, stimulating the economy, and using its vast network to help small businesses grow theirs through its Marketplace platform. “In addition to our wide reach and the jobs we’ve managed to create, we’re most proud of the positive impact we’ve had on the SMME industry by providing a platform for over 7,000 SMME Marketplace Sellers to sell to our customer-base,” says Zietsman.

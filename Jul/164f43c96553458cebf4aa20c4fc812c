Several new features are currently in the works for messaging service WhatsApp, according to the official WhatsApp official blog and insider website WABetaInfo. The most notable change will allow users to add a voice note as their status update.  Once enabled, users will see a voice recording button alongside the text and photo buttons in the status section. Tapping this button will let you record a voice note to use as your status. The voice note will only be shared with the people you choose within your status privacy settings, and the voice note will be end-to-end encrypted as other images and videos shared to your status. <img class="size-full wp-image-606588 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp.png" alt="" width="474" height="770" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp.png 474w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-185x300.png 185w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 85vw, 474px" /> Multi-phone support WhatsApp is also working on adding support for syncing chats across multiple smartphones, WABetaInfo reports. The ‘companion mode’ will allow users to link a secondary smartphone to their account. “The companion mode will allow users to link a secondary mobile device to their WhatsApp account without requiring an active Internet connection on the main device in order to send messages,” the group said. On 14 June, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced that WhatsApp was working on allowing Android users to transfer their data to iPhone. “We’re adding to WhatsApp the ability to securely switch between phones and transfer your chat history, photos, videos, and voice messages between Android and iPhone while maintaining end-to-end encryption,” Zuckerberg said. Emoji reactions Zuckerberg has also confirmed that Meta is rolling out the ability to use any emoji as a reaction on WhatsApp.  Previously, users could react to a message with one of five emojis instead of sending them in a separate text message. With the new update, WhatsApp is including all of its emojis for reactions. Meta said that app is gradually rolling out this feature to users, so it might not yet be available on your particular device and account. Users can access the feature long-pressing a message in WhatsApp. Read: Countries losing trust in the South African passport: minister

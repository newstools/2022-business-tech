The N2 Wild Coast Road, which stretches 410 km from the Gonubie Interchange in East London to the Mtamvuna river near Port Edward, will shorten the current distance by 85 kilometres in comparison to the current route. This will mean a travel time saving of between one-and-a-half to three hours for road users once it is completed saving the economy R1.5 billion annually, Sanral has said. After significant delays, including a protracted labour dispute,  the estimated completion date for the project has been scheduled for the end of 2025/the start of 2026. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272981" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Msikaba-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="940" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Msikaba-2.jpg 2500w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Msikaba-2-300x113.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Msikaba-2-768x289.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Msikaba-2-1024x385.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Msikaba-2-1200x451.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: South Africa can’t cope with the number of cars on its roads: minister

Automakers continue to fuel South Africa’s fast-growing SUV/crossover segments with models varying in price and size, and 2022 to date, has been no different. The South African Guild of Mobility Journalists (SAGMJ) earlier in June announced Toyota’s crossover the Corolla Cross, as its Car of the Year for 2022. Despite the popularity and early success of the Corolla Cross since its launch, the market continues to evolve thanks to new technology, new market entrants, and competitive price points in this space. In the early months of 2022, the Corolla Cross had impressively strong sales beating the VW Polo and Vivo; however, in May, it was replaced by its slightly cheaper cousin, the Urban Cruiser. Rival carmaker Volkswagen has also been incredibly active in the SUV/crossover space in recent months. The German firm is set to launch a new version of the VW T-Roc in July. As a compact SUV will sit between the recently launched Taigo and the Tiguan with a sharper exterior making its unmistaken crossover design more striking, the company said. The new T-Roc will be available in two distinct configurations with two different engine offerings. Volkswagen will offer a sportier top-of-the-line R-Line with interior perks and more exterior design features, while the entry-level T-Roc Design sports stock features. The T-Roc can house either engine: A 1.4-litre turbo-petrol engine that uses an eight-speed automatic transmission with a power outage of 110kW and a maximum torque of 250Nm, or,
A 2.0litre turbo-petrol engine, paired with the VWs 4Motion all-wheel-drive system, pushing out 140kW and 320Nm. Pricing for the new crossover is yet to be released. BusinessTech looked at some of the new SUVs/crossovers that have entered the market in 2022, and how much they cost – at an average of R435,881. <img class="size-full wp-image-598832 aligncenter"

Retail group Pick n Pay is trialling a system that will allow motorists to renew their vehicle licences in-store. Pick n Pay said the system will allow customers to skip queues at traffic departments and post offices by setting up a profile and paying in-store at a till point. The group said renewals can be done for all areas in South Africa and will also allow customers to pay any outstanding fines that could be blocking a disc renewal in the same payment. Customers should receive their vehicle licence disc via courier within 10 business days, delivered to an address of their choice. How it works Register with your cellphone number at the till in-store or register on Pick n Pay’s website here.
Set up your profile and your payment on the portal and opt to pay in a Pick n Pay store.

Already a prime leisure and permanent residential destination for many South Africans, Mauritius is enjoying renewed interest in the pristine south-west of the island in the Bel Ombre area among those seeking a sustainable, luxury outdoor lifestyle, says Richard Haller, director of Pam Golding Properties Mauritius. He said that at Heritage Villas Valriche, a development comprising spacious villas surrounding a Peter Matkovich championship golf course and with two 5-Star hotels within the 2 400ha Heritage Bel Ombre estate situated just outside Le Morne and 35 minutes from Tamarin, 170 out of a total of 288 homes have been sold and completed. As many as 60% of these have been purchased by South Africans, Pam Golding said. “With flights to Mauritius recently reopened to South Africans, we are seeing an increased interest in clients wanting to fly out to acquire a residence on the island,” said Haller. “In prime location between the sea and mountains, with scenic views of the mountain, lagoon or golf course, this well-established estate has become a premier destination for South Africans as well as those from countries such as the UK and France, most of whom spend 5-12 months of the year in Mauritius and commute either a couple of times a year or as needed. “From here you can fly direct to Johannesburg, London, Paris, Perth or Dubai – whatever your preference.” Off-plan villas with generous terraces and rim-flow swimming pools are priced from $995,000 (approximately R15.5 million at the current exchange rate), while a number of bespoke villas, priced up to $6 million, have also been built to the specific brief of their discerning owners. All owners have access to a wide range of facilities on the estate. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-550852" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Heritage-Villas-Valriche--e1642150893514.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" /> “By purchasing a residence at Heritage Villas Valriche owners automatically enjoy a number of benefits including privileged access to: the Heritage C Beach Club, Heritage Le Telfair Golf & Wellness Resort, Heritage Awali Golf & Spa Resort, Heritage Golf Club, Heritage Nature Reserve, and Heritage Villas Valriche Sports Centre – fitted with state-of-the-art equipment, as well as access to in-villa hotel services such as a private chef,” said Haller. As the first golf course was over-subscribed, a second golf course designed by Peter Matkovich and Louis Oosthuizen is currently under construction and due for completion in 2022. In addition, a quarter of the estate’s owners are already reaping the rewards of revenue generation via a rental pool. “The villas are rented out under the successful ‘Heritage The Villas’ brand, which continues to be awarded top ratings by TripAdvisor. Furthermore, to aid ease of ownership, a well-established Homeowners’ Association and centralised external villa maintenance is controlled by the homeowners,” said Haller. Another benefit, added Haller, is that as an Integrated Resort Scheme (IRS), foreign homeowners, their spouse and children under the age of 24 are entitled to Permanent Residency status in Mauritius. Furthermore, under their permit, homeowners with permanent residency can now even bring their parents with them – thereby enabling three generations to reside in the country.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-550848" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mauritius-e1642150694598.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> Anton de Waal, CEO of Heritage Villas Valriche, said: “A low-density development which forms part of the registered Bel Ombre UNESCO Man and Biosphere, this is arguably the most sustainable development on the island with breath-taking panoramic views and lush, landscaped green spaces in addition to the greenery of the golf course. “Owners enjoy preferential membership of our world-class PGA championship ‘Le Chateau’ golf course that hosts the Afrasia Bank Mauritius Open championship on the European, Asian and Sunshine tours, as well as our second ‘La Reserve’ course under construction. Owners also benefit from guaranteed subscription to the hotels and beach club for the next 50 years.” Haller said: “With Mauritius Airport only a 40-minute drive, Heritage Villas Valriche is ideal for those who prefer a more private, tranquil environment, but still have easy access to nearby Tamarin or Grand Baie.” Read: Digital workers in South Africa have joined the ‘great resignation’ – here’s where they want to go

President Cyril Ramaphosa will address South Africa on Monday evening (4 April 2022) at 20h00 on the country’s ongoing response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The president last addressed the nation on 22 March, when he announced regulations that would end South Africa’s state of disaster. The president could go a step further and lift the national state of disaster this evening. This was confirmed by Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in a media briefing on Tuesday (29 March), in which she indicated that the state of disaster could be lifted as soon as Tuesday (5 April). Dlamini-Zuma subsequently gazetted new regulations aimed at lifting South Africa’s national state of disaster, while still giving government controls to manage the Covid pandemic going forward. The country’s state of disaster is currently set to expire on 15 April 2022. While the national state of disaster was initially set to lapse on 15 June 2020, the act provides that it can be extended by the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs minister by notice in the gazette for one month at a time before it lapses. The government has relied on the regulations to introduce and give effect to lockdown restrictions, which it has used to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.

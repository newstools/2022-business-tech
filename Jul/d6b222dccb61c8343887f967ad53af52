Today is the final day of The Ultimate Checkout, which offers you epic deals from Takealot.com, Superbalist.com, and Mr D. The Ultimate Checkout is unique in that the deals offered are based on an analysis of aggregated behaviour and trends from their respective platforms of over 6.5 million customers across takealot.com (online retail store), Superbalist.com (fashion and home) and Mr D (online food delivery). Click here to shop The Ultimate Checkout sale deals. “Our ability to curate deals based on products that our shoppers actually want is what really makes The Ultimate Checkout the most epic shopping experience of the year,” said Julie-Anne Walsh, Takealot’s Chief Marketing Officer. Takealot Group’s three major platforms are all designed to make online shopping easy – no matter whether you’re using a PC, tablet, or your smartphone. Once you’ve confirmed your order, you won’t have to wait long to receive your goods, either – thanks to Takealot’s speedy next-day delivery and collection options. These next-day services are available for FREE when shopping on Takealot.com and Superbalist.com during The Ultimate Checkout. Additionally, if you make at least one purchase from all three platforms during The Ultimate Checkout sale, you will stand a chance to win The Ultimate Night-in – worth over R100,000. The winner will receive vouchers for a vast range of products like appliances, technology items, home decor, fashion, and R33,000 worth of Mr D for a year – allowing you to create the perfect night-in from the comfort of your own home.

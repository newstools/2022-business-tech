Broad Media is looking for a young, smart equity analyst for an exciting new project in the media space. Click here to apply for the position. The position suits a young professional with a university degree and experience analysing listed companies. You should enjoy doing a quick analysis of many different companies using different investment models. If you prefer doing a deep analysis of a single company, the job is not for you. This project needs a T20 pinch hitter, not a conservative test cricket batsman. You need to have a strong grasp of accounting, financial reporting, and the stock market. You must also have a strong mathematics ability. In return, we offer a great working environment, a competitive salary, and very interesting work in the investment space. This is an office-based position. We are keen to learn from you, and we will also help you to gain knowledge and experience in the media space.

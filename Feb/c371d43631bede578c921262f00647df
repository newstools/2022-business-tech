MTN Business has launched the MTN Made for Skhokho prepaid packages tailored for small and informal businesses. The MTN Made for Skhokho prepaid plans, provide greater value and flexibility to help businesses navigate the current tough economic conditions, the operator said. “Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and business in the informal sector play an important role in South Africa’s economy by providing employment opportunities as well as driving much-needed growth. Added to the recent negative impact brought on by Covid-19, SMEs continue to face many headwinds, including the high cost of running a business, excessive red tape, lack of access to markets, financing and technical knowledge,” said Wanda Matandela, chief business and enterprise officer at MTN Business. “The MTN Made for Skhokho prepaid package is designed to help by addressing connectivity challenges so that SMEs can thrive and enjoy all the benefits and opportunities of the modern, connected world.” MTN Business offers small, medium, and large bundle packages with validity of 7 /14/ and 30 days respectively. “Small businesses are the backbone of local communities and an engine-room for jobs and growth. They have the power to transform – but to do that they must be connected all the time and it is our aim, with constant innovation and best quality network, to deliver solutions that add value to their businesses,” said Matandela.

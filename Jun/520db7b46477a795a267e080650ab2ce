The South African Revenue Services (SARS) says that taxpayers will be able to file their tax returns from 1 July 2022. Taxpayers should also be aware of the shortened time frames to submit their returns for the 2023 tax season, beginning 1 March 2022 – to 28 February 2023. Income tax return filing dates: 1 July to 24 October 2022 – This is the period for taxpayers who file online. Taxpayers who cannot file online can do so at a SARS branch by appointment only.
1 July to 23 January 2023 – This is the period for Provisional taxpayers including Trusts may file via eFiling or SARS MobiApp. “With Individual Filing Season starting in July 2022, we have made it easier and convenient to be tax compliant with SARS auto-assessment,” the revenue service said. If you fail to submit a tax return, SARS can charge an administrative penalty which can range from R250 to R16,000 per month or R3,000 to R192,000 per year. “It does appear though, at the moment, that SARS is issuing smaller penalties ranging between R500 and R2000,” said Momentum, “but we never know when this could change”. “Many taxpayers are receiving penalties for old unfiled tax returns even if they were not required to submit tax returns based on the two reasons explained at the end of this blog. Taxpayers, after filing their 2021 return are suddenly being issued penalty notices for outstanding returns for previous years,” said Momentum. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-594460" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Tax.png" alt="" width="1119" height="733" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Tax.png 1119w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Tax-300x197.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Tax-1024x671.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Tax-768x503.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Justonelap data shows that the effective tax rate of an individual is not the same as the rate of tax per tax bracket.

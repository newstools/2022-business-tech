Multichoice has announced price increases for its DStv packages for 2022. At 2.7%, the weighted adjustment across all of DStv’s offerings for 2022 is significantly lower than the projected CPI for the year, the group said in a statement on Tuesday (8 February). From 1 April 2022, Premium subscribers will pay 1.21% or R10 more per month. There are similar adjustments for Compact Plus (+1.86% or R10), Compact (+4.89% or R20), Family (+4.75% or R14) and DStv Access (+4.35% or R5). Pricing for Easyview, Showmax, Add Movies and BoxOffice will remain unchanged for 2022, MultiChoice said. “DStv has considered the challenges facing South African consumers and has once again absorbed as much of the increase of the cost of doing business as possible in order to implement minimal adjustments,” said Nyiko Shiburi, MultiChoice South Africa chief executive. “We realise that customers remain under pressure two years into the Covid-19 pandemic. These adjustments will help us to ensure that South Africans continue to enjoy the best value, and unrivalled access to entertainment, anywhere, anytime, and at the most affordable price.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556396" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DStv-pricing-2022.png" alt="" width="692" height="791" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DStv-pricing-2022.png 692w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DStv-pricing-2022-262x300.png 262w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> DStv Premium subscribers get Showmax as a value-added service at no additional charge (100% discount) and DStv Compact, Compact Plus, Family and Access subscribers get Showmax at a 50% discount.

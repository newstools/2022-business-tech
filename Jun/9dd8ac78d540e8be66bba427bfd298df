The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) has announced that the N3 highway will be intermittently fully closed on 21 June 2022 between the hours of 10h00 to 14h00 to facilitate the work of Eskom engineers. The project will see the height of Eskom’s 88kV overhead powerlines crossing the N3 increased, the agency said. “The intermittent full closures will take place between the Camperdown and Lynnfield Park interchanges. The closures are necessary to increase the height of Eskom’s 88kV overhead powerlines crossing the N3 that is currently undergoing upgrades. Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) will manage and monitor the diversion of traffic,” said Corné Roux, Saral’s Eastern Region project engineer: pavement and materials. The intermittent full road closures are scheduled to take place as follows: 10h00 to 10h30 – Close N3 and lower overhead electrical cables
10h30 to 10h50 – Reopen N3 for heavy vehicles
10h50 to 11h20 – Close N3 to string first conductor
11h20 to 11h40 – Reopen N3 for heavy vehicles
11h40 to 12h10 – Close N3 to string second conductor
12h10 to 12h30 – Reopen N3 for heavy vehicles
12h30 to 13h00 – Close N3 to string third conductor
13h00 to 13h20 – Reopen N3 for heavy vehicles
13h20 to 13h50 – Close N3 to complete stringing of earth cables
13h50 – Reopen N3 for all vehicles <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-596760" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/N3-closures-June.png" alt="" width="1420" height="703" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/N3-closures-June.png 1420w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/N3-closures-June-300x149.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/N3-closures-June-1024x507.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/N3-closures-June-768x380.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/N3-closures-June-1200x594.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Light motor vehicle traffic will be diverted via the R103 at the N3 Northbound Camperdown (Exit 57) off-ramp when driving towards Pietermaritzburg and N3 Southbound Lynnfield Park (Exit 65) off-ramp when driving towards Durban. Substantial delays will be experienced as the R103 is currently under stop/go operation due to emergency repairs. Heavy motor vehicles will be stacked on the N3 on both bounds between the Camperdown and Lynnfield Park Interchanges. “The closure may need to be adjusted depending on weather conditions on the day. If that happens, a second notice with information of the new time will be issued. Motorists are urged to make use of alternative routes as directed, plan and adjust their route trips on time and adhere to speed limits. “Sanral apologises to the motoring public for any inconvenience caused and thank them for their patience during road construction,” said Roux.

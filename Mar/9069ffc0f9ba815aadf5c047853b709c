Discovery Bank has launched its inaugural Spend Trend report, a fascinating look into top money trends and spending habits among the Bank’s client base over the last year. Click here to view the Discovery Bank Spend Trend Report The aggregate data confirms a shift to real-time payments and reveals interesting spending patterns such as a preference for online shopping on Mondays. Personalised reports are available for qualifying clients who have been with the Bank since July last year. In a country with statistically proven poor money management skills, Discovery Bank is built, from its core, to improve financial behaviours. In this way, the Bank actively encourages and rewards behaviours that improve our clients’ financial wellbeing. This generates higher savings levels, lowers their risk for the bank and increases the wealth of society overall. “Budgeting can be really intimidating and boring for most people but it’s really important; the first step towards improving your financial position is having an accurate understanding of what it is, so we decided to run some fun analyses on our Discovery Bank client base to get a better idea of their spending and saving habits over the past year.” “Part of managing money well is knowing exactly what you’re spending money on, where you are possibly overspending and following an accurate and appropriate budget,” Hylton Kaller, CEO of Discovery Bank says. Monthly card spend increased over 30% during 2021 in line with lockdown levels. Spend is returning to pre-pandemic levels with increases in travel and eating out while home improvement and grocery spend decreased as a proportion of total spend. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-570712 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Discovery-Spend-Trenbd-Report-March-2022-Clothing.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Discovery-Spend-Trenbd-Report-March-2022-Clothing.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Discovery-Spend-Trenbd-Report-March-2022-Clothing-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Discovery Bank’s clients have favourite days of the week for specific transactions.

For takeout and eating out, couples and families prefer Friday’s, while Singles opt for Saturday’s

This is evident from the significant increase in the use of taps.” “Not only is tapping your phone, smartwatch or Discovery Bank card a more convenient way to pay, but it’s also faster and safer, closely followed by secure online shopping.” “Tap payments grew by 132% in 2021, online payments grew by 58%, while swipe/chip payments only grew by 1%.” Apple Pay is leading mobile contactless payments amongst Discovery Bank clients with 86% of the total, while Samsung Pay and Garmin Pay own 4.4% and 1.4% respectively. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-570724 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Discovery-Bank-Spend-Trend-Report-Mobile-Payments-per-provider.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Discovery-Bank-Spend-Trend-Report-Mobile-Payments-per-provider.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Discovery-Bank-Spend-Trend-Report-Mobile-Payments-per-provider-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In addition to reporting on general trends, Spend Trend generates personalised reports for engaged Discovery Bank client with a credit card account, transaction account or full banking suite. Qualifying clients can access their personal Spend Trend reports in their banking app. Kallner concludes, “While our custom Spend Trend reports give clients a fun, shareable snapshot of their spending habits over the last year – financial awareness and education are critical in enabling better financial decision making.” “Understanding finances is often difficult and confusing – which is why Discovery Bank is trying to simplify it by leveraging the Vitality Money programme to change client financial behaviours for the better.” “Vitality Money is not about measuring how much money you make, but how you use the money you have to build financial independence and resilience in the long term.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-570758 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eating-Out-and-Takeaways.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="967" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eating-Out-and-Takeaways.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eating-Out-and-Takeaways-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />

Eskom chief operating officer Jan Oberholzer says load shedding is set to continue throughout the weekend as the power utility works to restore its units and reserves following prolonged strike action. In a media briefing on Friday (1 July), Oberholzer said that weekend load shedding will take place as follows: Friday (1 July) Stage 4 load shedding will be implemented until 16h00
Stage 6 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00-22h00 Saturday and Sunday (2 and 3 July) Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 00h00 – 07h00
Stage 4 load shedding will be implemented from 07h00 – 00h00 Chief executive Ande De Ruyter said the power utility was currently facing total outages of 13,609MW, with 2,709MW out due to unlawful industrial action. He added that there were still some labour issues, despite both Eskom and union leadership issuing a return-to-work call. “Eskom is now working to source additional diesel supplies from wherever it can, but low reserves mean it has no choice but to move to stage 6 load shedding from 16h00 this afternoon, ” Oberholzer added that a detailed assessment is still required to identify the damage caused by the strikes, and how long it will take to address. This means South Africa can expect an even more unstable power system than usual in the coming weeks, he said. However, Oberholzer reiterated that South Africa is not facing the possibility of a total blackout, as this was the entire point of load shedding and protecting the electricity grid.

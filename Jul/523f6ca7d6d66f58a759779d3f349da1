The Department of Energy has published the fuel price adjustments for July 2022, showing a massive hike for both petrol and diesel. The price adjustments for July include an additional 75 cents per litre which is being added back to the general fuel levy as the government tapers off its interventions first introduced in May. The August price adjustment is expected to add a further 75 cents per litre, ending the interventions altogether. Prices will be adjusted as follows: The changes will be implemented on Wednesday, 6 July. According to the department, the average international product prices for petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin increased during the period under review. The rand appreciated against the US dollar during the period under review, on average, when compared to the previous period. The average rand/US dollar exchange rate for the period 27 May to 30 June 2022 was R15.76 compared to R15.95 during the previous period. This led to a lower contribution to the basic fuel prices on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 19.66 c/l, 20.73 c/l and 20.71 c/l, respectively. The department reiterated that the temporary fuel price relief will be withdrawn from 3 August 2022. With effect from 6 July 2022, the fuel levy in the price structure of petrol and diesel will therefore amount to 319 c/l and 305 c/l respectively in the price structure of both petrol and diesel. While both grades of petrol (93 and 95) are typically aligned, in terms of the Working Rules to administer the BFP, the differentials between 95 and 93 petrol grades are adjusted at the beginning of each quarter. The BFP differentials between 95 and 93 petrol grades have changed and therefore the different price adjustments between the two grades. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-602714" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fuel-price-changes-July-2022.png" alt="" width="989" height="375" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fuel-price-changes-July-2022.png 1660w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fuel-price-changes-July-2022-300x114.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fuel-price-changes-July-2022-1024x388.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fuel-price-changes-July-2022-768x291.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fuel-price-changes-July-2022-1536x582.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fuel-price-changes-July-2022-1200x455.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> There was no change to the slate levy over the period.

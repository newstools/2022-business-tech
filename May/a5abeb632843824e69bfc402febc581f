Due to lower weekend demand, Eskom has announced load shedding will be lowered to stage 1 from 22h00 on Friday evening until 05h00 on Monday (9 May). “It is possible to reduce the stage of load shedding during the weekend due to the lower demand and in anticipation of generation units returning to service during the weekend. Eskom will continue to monitor the system
and implement any changes as required,” the power utility said. “Since yesterday morning a generation unit each at Malta, Hendrina and Arnot power stations have returned to service. At the same time, however, a generation unit each at Kendal and Matimba power stations tripped, while the non-commercial unit at Kusile power station was taken offline. Further, delays in returning two generators to service at the Tutuka Power Station have added to the capacity constraints.” Eskom said it expects to rely on the use of emergency generating reserves to supplement available supply and to limit the stage of load shedding during this period. “We currently have 4,323MW on planned maintenance, while another 15,410MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. Eskom would again like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We, therefore, request the public to continue using electricity sparingly to reduce the occurrence of load shedding.”  Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

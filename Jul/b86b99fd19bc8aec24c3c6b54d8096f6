South Africans love cars from Toyota, and many are planning to move to the brand when they buy their next vehicle. This was one of the findings from BusinessTech’s 2022 Readership Survey. BusinessTech is the largest business publication in South Africa – read by C-level executives, business owners, company directors, managers, and professionals every day. The 2022 Readership Survey was conducted in July, and completed by 2,684 BusinessTech readers. 93% of these readers are a purchasing decision maker or influencer in their household, providing excellent insight into what South African consumers think of the country’s top brands. Looking at the Automotive Brands section of the survey, Toyota was the most popular car brand among BusinessTech readers. It was followed closely by VW in second, while Ford sat a bit further back in third. It is interesting to note the BMW took fourth spot in the ranking, illustrating the spending power of BusinessTech’s readers.

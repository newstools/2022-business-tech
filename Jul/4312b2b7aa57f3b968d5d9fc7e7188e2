iVIEW Library – Data governance
iVIEW Designer – Data visualization Informatec has launched iVIEW Library in South Africa and will soon bring iVIEW Dataflow and iVIEW Designer to the country. iVIEW Library functions as a single point of truth from which you can view and access all your Qlik data and applications. This allows businesses to track their KPIs through a single platform and ensure these KPIs are measurable, actionable, and transparent. If this is not the case, iVIEW Library allows users to adjust these KPIs accordingly so that you are judging your business’s performance by the right metrics. iVIEW Library’s global search function then streamlines this process, making it easy to access important data on demand, and the tool also uses automation to simplify many important data governance processes in the background. All this functionality combines to give you a holistic view of your Qlik data, and the ability to access and use it through a simple standalone web application. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-610512 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Informatec-in-article-image-July-2022.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Informatec-in-article-image-July-2022.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Informatec-in-article-image-July-2022-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> iVIEW Library helps businesses define and enrich their data through powerful technologies and features that are easy to use.

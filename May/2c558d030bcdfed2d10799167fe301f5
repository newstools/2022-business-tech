Nielsen’s Global Marketing Report 2022 shows that companies plan to increase the amount of money they spend on digital marketing. The report showed that social media, online display, online video, and search were the channels forecast to receive the biggest marketing budget increases over the coming year. Conversely: radio, cinema, print, and TV were the channels set to receive the smallest marketing budget increases. “Unlike the finite amount of time in a single day, device and platform choices are seemingly infinite,” said Jamie Moldafsky, Nielsen Chief Marketing Officer. “As consumers toggle between devices and platforms, it’s clear that their attention can be divided. But there’s always a time and place where they focus – and that’s where marketers must be, armed with the right message.” Nielsen’s report stated that marketing budgets at companies are set to increase across the board, following a pullback in spend during the height of the Covid pandemic. “In select digital channels, the planned increase will be as high as 53%,” stated the report. This is detailed in the graph below, which shows that digital marketing channels are set to feature strongly over the coming year.

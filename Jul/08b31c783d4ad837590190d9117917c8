Power utility Eskom has announced that load shedding will be kept to stage 1 and stage 2 over the coming weekend, but will still be at stage 3 on Friday. Load shedding will also continue into next week, it said, though it anticipates lower stages of load shedding will be adequate, as some units return to service. “This will be confirmed closer to the time, or as major changes occur. Should anything change in the intervening period, Eskom will communicate and implement any changes as may be necessary,” it said. The group said that it currently has 4,501MW on planned maintenance, while another 16,320MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “As the generation capacity shortages persist over the next few weeks, load shedding will continue to be implemented at various stages. Eskom cautions the public that it will still take a few weeks for the power generation system to recover.” For Thursday, load shedding will continue at stage 3 until 16h00, then it will escalate to stage 4 until midnight. The new schedule also shows time slots where no load shedding is planned, pointing to a steady move back to only peak-hour load shedding. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-606810" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Thursday-14-July.png" alt="" width="857" height="534" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Thursday-14-July.png 857w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Thursday-14-July-300x187.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Load-shedding-Thursday-14-July-768x479.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />  Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

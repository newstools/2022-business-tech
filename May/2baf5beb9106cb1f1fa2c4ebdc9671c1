Wise Move has been designed with the user in mind. All you have to do is fill out the easy online delivery request that prompts you for information based on your response at each step. This will get all the necessary details of your move. Next, Wise Move connects your request to moving companies that match your area, route, and needs. Finally, vetted movers get to bid on your request. You can then easily compare, check reviews and book! It’s as simple as 1-2-3. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-347053" src="https://test.businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-05-03-at-06.48.27.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" /> Trust is an essential part of choosing a moving company. Wise Move has created a platform where you can now check verified reviews, see past public correspondence from the moving company you’re considering for your move, and get the best price because companies are incentivised to do so. All the companies on the platform are also vetted. This, as it turns out, is a manual process where the team at Wise Move verifies the company details, documents and services. Going through each mover’s application must be a painstaking effort – but it speaks volumes about the company’s commitment to its users. Finally, Wise Move is all about transparency. “We believe in giving you a real picture of what your move will cost, and that’s why we’ve made all past quotes publicly accessible,” mentions Mr Gediminas. No more wondering if you’re getting a fair price—just search on Wise Move to see what other people have paid for the same type of move and compare it to the quote you’re considering. The key to Wise Move’s ease of use is our unique business model that offers an optimised approach to getting moving quotes. Wise Move helps you find the lowest moving quote in your area by allowing moving companies to bid for your work. We know that everyone wants to get the best service at the best price, and we want to help you do exactly that. Our platform allows moving companies to bid for your work. For example, one mover might have some extra space in his truck that he can offer you at a low cost. Another company might not have anything to transport on the way back from a previous move, but you’re on their route – so they can help you out. These are only a few reasons that make it possible for us to help you find the best quote while helping moving companies get more work. “If you’re a mover, your livelihood gets better – you get more work and more honest client feedback.” “If you’re a client, you get to move with the confidence that your things are safe, professionals are handling your move, and that you got the best possible deal,” added Mr Gediminas.

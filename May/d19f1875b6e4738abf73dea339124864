Gauteng’s MEC for Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure Jacob Mamabolo has announced the new route for phase 1 of the proposed Gauteng Rapid Rail Integrated Network (GRRIN) project. In 2014, Gauteng’s provincial government commissioned the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve mobility in the Gauteng. This strategy included the undertaking of a feasibility study to investigate possible extensions to the rapid rail network in the province. Mamabolo said the route was determined following a thorough consultation process and is the first step in the process of defining a rail reserve for a future railway line in Gauteng. The next step in the process will be to undertake a preliminary design for phase 1 of the proposed GRRIN Extensions and will include a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), as well as further consultation with all interested and affected parties, he said. “It is important to note that the route determination is an important milestone in the province’s rail planning process and that we are still in the early stages of the process of defining the future rail reserve that will be undertaken with consultation with all interested and affected parties and stakeholders.” New route The proposed route for phase 1 of the GRRIN extensions begins at the proposed location of a new station at Little Falls, which is located to the east of Hendrik Potgieter Road in Willowbrook. From the proposed Little Falls Station, the route runs in a northeasterly direction towards Zandspruit where the route will pass to the west of Jackal Creek Golf Estate. The route then changes in a southeasterly direction towards Cosmo City and a newly proposed Cosmo City Station. From the Cosmo City Station, the route will continue in a southeasterly direction towards the newly proposed Randburg Station, passing through North Riding, Olivedale, Bryanston, and Ferndale. The route will continue in a southeasterly direction through Randburg, Bordeaux, and Hurlingham. Once it has reached Sandhurst the route will change direction towards the existing Sandton Station where an upgraded station is proposed. From Sandton, the route will run in a northeasterly direction through Sandton, Sandown, Marlboro, and Alexandra towards the existing Marlboro Station where the existing station will be upgraded to accommodate the new alignment. The below graphic shows how the new route will fit into the existing Gautrain model. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-282740" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gautrain-1.jpg" alt="" width="714" height="417" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gautrain-1.jpg 714w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gautrain-1-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Here are the new Gautrain fees for 2022

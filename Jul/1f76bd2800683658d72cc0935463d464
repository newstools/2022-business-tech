The first batch of 1,200 Protons, due to go on sale in South Africa this year, have officially been offloaded in Durban, the group said on Tuesday (5 July). The Malaysian carmaker Proton makes a return to South Africa by entering into an agreement with Combined Motor Holdings (CMH) to be a distributor for its vehicles locally. CMH will be supported in the market by 25 dedicated Proton Dealerships. Geely, who owns Volvo, Lotus, and is a significant shareholder of Mercedes Benz, purchased Proton in 2017 and commenced with an aggressive upgrade to the product offering. The ownership, Proton said, has allowed the group to incorporate the latest European technologies and designs into the Proton X50 and X70 the two variants launching in South Africa in September. The equivalent Geely left-hand drive versions have sold over 2.8 million cars globally, contributing to Geely’s status as the world’s 8th biggest car manufacturer, it said. Starting from R450,000, the Proton X50 and X70 will be available for purchase from September 2022. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-603198" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/X50Proton-e1657020062677.png" alt="" width="1000" height="430" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-581528" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2020-Proton-X50-e1651153413130.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> Marketed as ‘affordable luxury’, Proton said that the X50 and X70 have class-leading engines, technologies, designs, safety features and warranties that allow them to compete with European luxury brands, ‘but without the excessive cost the comes with owning a luxury SUV’. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-603196" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ProtonX70-e1657020077130.png" alt="" width="1000" height="433" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-581530" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ProtonX70-e1651153405290.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="802" /> Read: Proton cars to make return to South Africa later this year

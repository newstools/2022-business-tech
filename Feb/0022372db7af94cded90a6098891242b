Nedbank has published its latest capital expenditure project listing report, detailing some of the major fixed investment projects planned for South Africa. The bank’s listing shows that fixed investment activity is starting to show signs of life, following the pandemic-induced implosion and the prolonged slump from 2014. Notably, a total of R208 billion in new projects were announced in 2021, up from R72 billion over 2020 and R138 billion over 2019. “The private sector is leading the revival, planning R120 billion of new projects, accounting for 58% of all new projects announced in 2021,” the bank said. “Capital projects by government and public corporations also picked up, driven the government’s ambitious plans to restore the country’s ageing and eroded economic infrastructure.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-556758 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-1024x343.png" alt="" width="840" height="281" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-1024x343.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-300x100.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-768x257.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-1200x402.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank.png 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Nedbank said that it expects capital spending to rise off a low base in 2022, but to still end the year below its pre-pandemic levels. The upside will remain constrained by the electricity shortage, other infrastructure constraints, slow progress with structural reforms and persistent policy uncertainty in some industries, it said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-556762 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-2-1024x411.png" alt="" width="840" height="337" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-2-1024x411.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-2-300x120.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-2-768x308.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-2-1200x481.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nedbank-2.png 1289w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The below table shows some of the major public and private sector projects currently in the works for South Africa based on Nedbank’s data. The government announced plans to embark on a massive infrastructure drive to revive the economy in 2020. The goal is to invest R2.3 trillion in 276 projects over the next ten years. Of these, 50 projects were flagged as priority projects, with a total value of R352 billion. Table 3 shows the 50 priority Strategic Integrated Projects and the allocations per major sector. Most of these projects were not included in Nedbank’s calculations for 2021 because critical details on the value, scope and timing are unavailable. The Nedbank schedule only captures about R57.9 billion of R352 billion or 17.8% of the government’s priority projects. The projects included that fall under the umbrella of Strategic Integrated Projects are the N2 and N3 highway upgrade, phase 2 of the SA Connect project, the student housing programme, phase 2 of the Crocodile Mokolo water scheme, and the One-Stop Border Posts.

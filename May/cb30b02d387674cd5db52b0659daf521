Toyota and Volkswagen continue to dominate the motoring landscape in South Africa, while hatchbacks and SUVs remain the preferred body shape for passenger vehicle owners. TopAuto reports that Toyota was the best-selling vehicle brand in April, with 8,952 units sold, and despite a temporary shutdown of its KwaZulu-Natal-based factory due to severe floods in the area. In April 2022, 37,107 new vehicles were sold in South Africa, marking a 1,516-unit (4.3% ) increase when compared to the same period in 2021. New vehicle sales in April were buoyed by strong purchases from the vehicle rental industry, as other segments performed weaker than anticipated, said Naamsa. Out of the 37,107 total sales during the month, 88.4% represented sales to dealerships, 9.1% represented sales to the vehicle rental industry, 1.5% represented sales to the government, and 1.0% represented sales to industry corporate fleets. Out of these sales, the passenger-car market accounted for 26,653 units, reflecting a 12.9% increase when compared to April 2021. On the other hand, light commercial vehicles including bakkies and mini-buses sold 9,558 vehicles last month, 11.9% lower than a year before, noted TopAuto. The sales performance of both medium and heavy trucks also fell in April by 9.4% and 4.6%, respectively – to a total of 475 units and 1,421 units moved. Bestsellers Toyota kept its lead as the best-selling car brand in South Africa in April, although VW is now much closer on its heels than it was in March. Suzuki and Hyundai swopped places in April when compared to a month before, with Suzuki now in third and Hyundai in fourth. Renault and Nissan also traded their spots, Renault now taking up fifth place and Nissan sixth. Kia had a better month than most, though, and went all the way from ninth in March to seventh in April, whereas Ford went from seventh to eighth. Haval was ninth in April, while Isuzu has held the 10th best-selling position for the fourth consecutive month. Market share Data contained in the Q4 2021 TransUnion Vehicle Price Index shows how carmakers fare when it comes to market share. Light commercial Vehicles by Sales Volume Toyota had an exceptional quarter in new and used LCV finance, capturing 55% and 33%, respectively. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586262" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LightPassengerVehicles.png" alt="" width="932" height="264" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LightPassengerVehicles.png 932w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LightPassengerVehicles-300x85.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LightPassengerVehicles-768x218.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Passenger Vehicles by Sales Volume Toyota and VW have done well in both areas, sharing the top two spots in both new and used; although Renault, Hyundai and Suzuki had a great quarter alongside Toyota in new passenger vehicles, TransUnion noted. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586264" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PassengerVehicles.png" alt="" width="966" height="269" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PassengerVehicles.png 966w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PassengerVehicles-300x84.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PassengerVehicles-768x214.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Body Type <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586260" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion1-1.png" alt="" width="976" height="275" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion1-1.png 976w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion1-1-300x85.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion1-1-768x216.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />Consumers aged 26–40 finance almost half of vehicles, with most financing used cars. More than 47% of total new and used vehicles financed are hatchbacks and 25% SUVs. A higher proportion of new cross-overs than sedans financed suggests a preference for multipurpose vehicles, the credit expert said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586258" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion2.png" alt="" width="961" height="272" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion2.png 961w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion2-300x85.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion2-768x217.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Despite recent interest rate hikes, consumers continue to pursue value in the used vehicle market, said TransUnion. The percentage of new and used cars below R200k, R200k to R300k and over R300k financed saw year-on-year movement from under R200k into the over R200-R300k bracket. “The over R300k band remains the highest since we started tracking in 2011 — a positive sign going into the next quarter, albeit at lower volumes.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586268" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="236" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion-1.png 900w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion-1-300x79.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TransUnion-1-768x201.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Volkswagen reveals new compact SUV coupé for South Africa

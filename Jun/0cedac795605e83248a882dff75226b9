Petrol prices are at an all-time high in South Africa, following the latest hikes for June. Record prices were driven by the conflict in Ukraine – and resulting sanctions against Russia, supply-chain bottlenecks, and a tightening of global monetary policy. “The increases are significant and will hurt all consumers and they will undoubtedly exert inflationary pressure on the economy,” said the Automobile Association. Debt Rescue chief executive Neil Roets said that the latest hike takes increases in the petrol price over the past 12 months to 41.5% – and all indications are that prices will continue to rise in the coming months. “This is also the highest month-on-month increase ever recorded – a whopping 11% increase from May 2022 to June 2022,” he said. This is how the price changes will reflect at the pumps: With projections that prices are likely to continue to rise, loyalty and reward programs offer consumers some respite at petrol stations across the country. According to Melissa Hanley, head of marketing at Pick n Pay, the global pandemic saw more consumers turn to loyalty programmes, with nearly 75% of consumers using loyalty programmes in 2021. And in recent months, several big brands have launched reward programmes of their own. Chemicals company Sasol recently launched a new customer rewards programme offering savings on fuel purchases and other benefits, while Capitec also came to the party in 2021, partnering with Shell service stations. Sanlam is the most recent entrant to offer fuel rewards through its Money Saver credit card. It has partnered with Total Energies to give customers a guaranteed R1 per litre back.

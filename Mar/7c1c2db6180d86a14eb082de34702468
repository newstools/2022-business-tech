This is a continuation of the trend that started in 2020, as remote work and project-driven outcomes have become the norm and financial demands favour the use of expert contractors, the group said. “While we continued to see demand from financial services, not least the insurance sector, strong growth was also coming through from Big 4 consulting clients. This was off the back of new projects as well as the reinstatement of projects put on ice initially by the onset of Covid,” said Johann van Niekerk, managing director of Outsized South Africa. “We also saw a resurgence of interest from the rest of Africa, and anticipate this trend for both areas to continue in 2022 as uncertainties related to the pandemic continue to decrease.” The global trend of making use of remote resources has also seen increased interest in the use of skills from South Africa, both for the quality and price they offer, it said. “This is increasing and expected to continue to do so.” South Africa Outsized said the following skills and jobs have seen a broad increase in demand for the following skills: Actuarial skills – South Africa has a deep talent pool in this area;

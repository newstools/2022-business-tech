Online talk show Business Talk has produced an exciting new series in partnership with Sage. The series, titled Sage helping businesses flow, launches soon and will include conversations with South Africa’s top finance, fintech, and business professionals. Business Talk has grown phenomenally since it launched in November 2020 and it reached 1.5 million views earlier this year. A big reason for the show’s success is its popular radio and TV personality host, Michael Avery. Avery is well known for his anchor roles on the Business Day TV show, the HOT Business Show on HOT 1027, and the Classic Business show on Classic FM. In this Business Talk series, Avery will be joined by prominent guests and business owners as they discuss topics like accounting, finance, HR, and much more. These industry experts will provide rare insights into their areas of expertise and will unpack the latest trends in the local finance industry. The new episodes will be available on the Business Talk website and BusinessTech’s YouTube and Facebook pages.

South Africa’s top companies all have one thing in common: they advertise on BusinessTech. BusinessTech is the largest and most influential business news website in South Africa, with 7 million monthly readers, and counts the country’s top companies among its clients. This includes Standard Bank, FNB, Capitec, Nedbank, Absa, MTN, Vodacom, Telkom, Discovery, Takealot, BCX, OUTsurance, Alexander Forbes, and hundreds more. Our international clients include Samsung, Dell, Microsoft, Huawei, Acer, and ASUS, to name a few. The reason South Africa’s top companies advertise on BusinessTech is simple: our marketing campaigns provide unmatched exposure, engagement, and ROI for our clients. BusinessTech is read by millions of C-level executives, business owners, company directors, managers, and professionals every month. This means that each time a company runs an advertising campaign on the site, they are guaranteed to reach an influential audience with purchasing power – in both the B2B and B2C segments. BusinessTech’s advertising options include sponsored articles, social media promotions, site takeovers, video interviews, dedicated mailers, display banners, and more.

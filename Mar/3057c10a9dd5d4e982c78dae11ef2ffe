The Mexican Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice has published its latest ranking of the 50 most violent cities in the world, with four South African cities included among them. The report lists the 50 most violent cities by the number of murders per 100,000 people, only considering cities with populations exceeding 300,000, where murder statistics are made available. In the 2021/22 ranking, four South African cities feature in the top 50, led by Cape Town, which has dropped out of the top 10 to 11th place overall. As with previous years, the ranking is dominated by South American cities, with South Africa, Jamaica and the US being the only main regional outliers. Zamora, Mexico, ranked as the most violent city in the world, with over 196 murders per 100,000 people. The top 10 is completely dominated by Mexican cities, first through to eighth position being within the region. The US city of St Louis and Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, are the only non-Mexican cities featured in the top 10. While Cape Town has fallout out of the top 10, it still holds the top dishonour of having the highest number of murders overall, with 2,911 murders recorded for the period, giving a murder rate of 62.22 people murdered per 100,000. Cape Town’s murder rate is heavily weighted towards gang-related violence. Tijuana is the only other city to rack up over 2,000 murders, with the Mexican Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice recording 2,124 violent deaths over the period, giving it a murder rate of 103 people per 100,000 – fourth, overall. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-569228" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Most-violent-cities-2021.png" alt="" width="694" height="1084" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Most-violent-cities-2021.png 694w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Most-violent-cities-2021-192x300.png 192w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Most-violent-cities-2021-656x1024.png 656w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Nelson Mandela Bay (Gqeberha), ranks as the second most violent city in the country, having jumped from 45th in 2018/19, to 24th position in 2019/20.

Farzam Ehsani is the co-founder and CEO at VALR – a leading South African cryptocurrency exchange. He created the company in April 2018, and it has since become the largest independent cryptocurrency exchange on the continent – offering clients the ability to trade over 60 crypto assets using Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, or ZAR. Before founding VALR, Ehsani worked at Rand Merchant Bank for over six years – and was its blockchain lead for the last two years of this tenure. He is passionate about how cryptocurrency can transform the world’s financial systems and eliminate the segregation created by countries’ borders. In this conference session, Ehsani talks about how continuous innovation has driven VALR’s journey to success. He discusses two of VALR’s most recent innovations – the VALR Pay instant payments service, and the ability for clients to buy cryptocurrency with credit and debit cards. Ehsani also suggests how other FinTech industries can draw inspiration from organizations operating in the crypto space. He then unpacks the debate between FinTech businesses that believe crypto should be embraced and those who believe it is too unpredictable to be integrated into their business models. He concludes by providing predictions for how the cryptocurrency industry will evolve in the coming months and years. Watch the full conference session with Farzam Ehsani below.

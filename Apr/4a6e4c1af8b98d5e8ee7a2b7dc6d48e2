Eskom has requested the public to reduce electricity usage as the power generation system is severely constrained. Four generation units have suffered breakdowns, while the return to service of two other units has been delayed. This together with the inclement weather, which has increased the demand for electricity, has placed the power system under pressure, the group said in a statement on Monday afternoon (11 April). Eskom said it is working hard to return as many of these generation units to service as possible. “Today a generating unit each at Matla and Kriel power stations as well as two generating units at Camden Power Station experienced breakdowns. Furthermore, a generating unit each at Tutuka and Matla power stations have been delayed from returning to service, contributing to the current shortage of capacity.” Eskom said it currently has 4,984MW of outages due to planned maintenance, while another 15,514MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned breakdowns. “We urge the public to continue reducing electricity usage to help avoid the possibility of load shedding.  However, should the situation deteriorate further, load shedding may need to be implemented at short notice, as a last resort, in order to protect the national grid. We are presently relying on the adequate levels of emergency reserves to meet the country’s demand which is being carefully monitored. “This constrained supply situation may persist throughout the week. We will communicate should there be any significant changes to the supply situation.”  Read: Joburg hit by widespread power outages as it plans move to new model

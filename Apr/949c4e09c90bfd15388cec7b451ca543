Morgan Stanley increased its third- and fourth-quarter price forecasts for global benchmark Brent crude by $10 a barrel due to a greater-than-expected supply deficit driven by Russia and Iran. The bank raised its third quarter estimate to $130 a barrel and predicted a supply deficit of about 1 million barrels a day persisting throughout the year, according to a note dated April 21. While oil markets have short-term demand headwinds, they are outweighed by supply issues, it added. Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for daily Russian crude and condensate production losses to 2 million barrels, up from 1 million barrels, because of a widespread boycott of its products following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The war is nearing its third month despite diplomatic efforts for a cease-fire.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-579690" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bloomberg.png" alt="" width="946" height="245" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bloomberg.png 946w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bloomberg-300x78.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bloomberg-768x199.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />  Russian production has already fallen by about 900,000 barrels a day in the first half of April, earlier than expected, Morgan Stanley analysts including Martijn Rats and Amy Sergeant said. The bank added that there’s a “high risk” the European Union will enact an import embargo on Russian crude. Morgan Stanley scaled back its assumption for returning Iranian supply, citing the lengthy negotiations without a nuclear deal being agreed. The bank had expected flows to climb by about 1 million barrels a day between mid- and end-2022, but has lowered that forecast to 500,000 barrels a day. The likelihood of an agreement is now 50/50, the bank said. Morgan Stanley cut its oil demand growth forecast to 2.7 million barrels a day this year from 3.4 million barrels a day. In the short term, the market is contending with negative GDP revisions, the effects of China’s Covid Zero policy and a large release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

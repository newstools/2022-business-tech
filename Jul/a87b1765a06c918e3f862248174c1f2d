Eskom says it has seen some recovery in replenishing its emergency reserves, but will still need to introduce stage 6 load shedding for parts of Friday. “Overnight we have replenished our emergency reserves sufficiently to not require stage 6 load shedding during the morning,” the power utility said in a statement on Friday morning. “However, stage 6 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00-22h00 so as not to deplete these reserves any further. Stage 4 is being implemented until 16h00.” The power utility has previously indicated that a minimum of stage 4 load shedding will need to be implemented over the weekend. “The high levels of staff absenteeism and intimidation of working employees in some of the power stations is still rife. This has made it difficult to conduct routine maintenance and other operational requirements, which will further impact the reliability of generation units,” it said on Thursday. “Due to the unlawful and unprotected strike, which has caused widespread disruption to Eskom’s power plants, Eskom is still unable to return some generators to service. Eskom is compelled to take this unprecedented step to conserve emergency generation capacity to safeguard the power system.”  Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg

The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has announced an updated grants calendar for the remainder of 2022. The social security agency said it has made changes to the days that the various grants are paid following complaints from citizens, with payments now set to be made on the second day of each month from April 2022. If the second day of the month falls on a weekend or public holiday, the grants will be paid on the next working day, it said. The updated calendar for grants is as follows: <img class="size-full wp-image-570868 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Grants-payments.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="763" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Grants-payments.jpg 694w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Grants-payments-273x300.jpg 273w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> More than 46% of South Africans now collect some form of grant, with the extension of the R350 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant for another year expected to provide basic support for around 10 million unemployed South Africans as they look for work The severe impact of the pandemic on the economy and its ability to create jobs has raised new questions about the reliance on economic growth to address unemployment and poverty, and revived interest in the prospect of a basic income grant as another lever to tackle poverty and inequality, and engender a more inclusive growth path, the department said. The Department of Social Development now plans to initiate a feasibility assessment of a basic income grant during this financial year. “The Department will continue to contribute to processes that stimulate discussions around the resource modelling and implementation of the basic income grant (BIG),” minister Lindiwe Zulu said.  “The BIG promises to be a major policy engagement that we will be part of during the 2022/2023 financial year,” she said.

Aviation company Comair has suspended all of its flights in South Africa as it looks for additional funding. The airline which owns and operates Kulula.com flights also acts as a domestic franchise partner of British Airways in the country. “Comair regrets to advise its flights have been voluntarily suspended from 1 June pending securing funding to resume operations. If your flight has been cancelled, please don’t travel to airport unless you have alternative arrangements. Our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience.” “Once received the airline will be able to recommence operations, but regrettably under these circumstances, the practitioners (administrators) have no choice but to voluntarily suspend all scheduled flights until the funding is confirmed,” it said. Comair went into business rescue in May 2020 after the Covid-19 pandemic decimated the airline and travel industry. It resumed flying in December 2020, while still in business rescue. It has subsequently been forced to start and stop flights several times in the last 24 months due to ongoing lockdown restrictions. Most recently in March 2022, Comair was forced to ground all flights after safety concerns were raised by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA).

Nespresso has launched its mobile app in South Africa, allowing local coffee lovers to order their favourite Nespresso coffee from the palms of their hands. The Nespresso App is your one-stop shop for accessing your favourite Nespresso coffee at any time and from anywhere. Click here for more details about Nespresso. The app also lets you stay up to date with the latest offers, Limited Edition coffees, new product launches and much more. Nespresso South Africa is celebrating the launch of the app by offering free nationwide delivery for all app orders until the end of April 2022. This offer covers Nespresso coffee, machines, and accessories, which will all be delivered to your doorstep. The app also lets you learn more about your favourite coffees’ stories, origins, and sensory profiles to find the perfect coffee for your unique preferences. It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3: Upon completing this process, you will be able to order all the Nespresso products you could possibly want. Another great reason to drink Nespresso is that their capsules are recyclable, and you can save these capsules and then send them back to Nespresso after they’ve been used. There are many recycling options available to you – such as handing over your bag of used capsules to Nespresso’s courier partner or find a recycling corner at a boutique near you.

Power utility Eskom says that a recovery in generation capacity on Friday (13 May) means it will only have to implement stage 1 load shedding in the evening – and that the probability for weekend load shedding remains low. It announced earlier in the day that stage 2 load shedding would be implemented. Stage 1 load shedding will start at 17h00 and run to 22h00. “Barring any significant breakdowns, there is a low probability of load shedding being implemented during the weekend,” it said. “While we expect more generating units to return to service over the weekend, we appeal to all South Africans to limit the impact by reducing the usage of electricity and switch off all non-essential items.” Eskom said the onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. “Unfortunately, this would generally require the implementation of load shedding during the evening peaks,” it said. Eskom urged all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially between 05h00 and 09h00 in the mornings and 16h00 and 22h00 in the evenings.

The Department of Social Development has announced that South Africans will need to reapply for the R350 Social relief of distress grant as the government moves away from the national state of disaster framework. The entire application system remains a purely digital process, which will enable quick access and turnaround times, the department said. Applications can be lodged on the SASSA website and further communication will be issued as more application channels are opened. “All applicants are reminded that they will be considered for the Covid-19 SRD from the month in which the application is lodged, and this will be validated every month. This means that all applications lodged in April will be considered from April 2022.” The grant was initially introduced and distributed under the Disaster Management Act to provide relief to poor people and those left vulnerable due to the Covid pandemic. It will now be transferred under the Social Assistance Act. During his State of the Nation address in February, president Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the R350 grant would be extended to the end of March 2023. More than 10 million people depend on state money. “Given that the national state of disaster was lifted in April, the Department of Social Development has endeavoured to develop the regulatory framework for the payment of the Covid-19 SRD grant within the Social Assistance legislation,” it said. The department put out regulations for public comment in February 2022 and has now concluded the process. “The final steps such as obtaining the required concurrence and certification from the relevant departments have now been concluded, and the minister of social development has published the regulation through proclamation in the government gazette, notice 2042 of 2022 on Friday 22 April 2022.” Read: How many people can retire comfortably in South Africa

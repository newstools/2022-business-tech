Meta-owned messaging service WhatsApp is rolling out updates for its app with several new useful features previously only available to beta users. This includes new voice note functionality which will allow users to pause and resume voice recordings. Insider website WABetaInfo notes that this feature will help users frustrated with having their voice notes interrupted by incoming phone calls and having to start over or record their messages in parts. The feature will also allow users to listen to, delete, or continue recording the voice note before sending it. To use the feature, users must swipe up from the microphone button to lock a recording. WhatsApp will show a pause button to the left of the send button, which you can hit to halt the recording temporarily. When ready to continue, users can tap the microphone button again. They can also preview their recorded message before sending it by pressing the play button on the left. <img class="size-full wp-image-553330 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Voice-note.png" alt="" width="675" height="416" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Voice-note.png 675w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Voice-note-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Reactions to messages WhatsApp is developing a new feature that will allow iOS users to react to messages with an emoji similar to its sister app Facebook Messenger. This includes the ability to ‘like’ or ‘heart’ messages sent by other users. The feature is currently unavailable to WhatsApp’s wider user base but will likely be made available in an update released in the coming months. “Unfortunately, it’s still not possible to react to messages,” WABetaInfo said. “But the fact that it’s possible to manage these settings suggests that message reactions will be available very soon.” Chat migration WhatsApp is developing a feature that will allow you to migrate your chat history from Android to iOS and vice versa. While you can already migrate your chat history from iOS to Samsung Devices, this feature is expected to make it easier for users to manage their chat history should they swap operating systems. Android 12 devices are expected to receive chat history support from iOS at a later date. Two-step verification WhatsApp is also developing security changes to make two-step verification more manageable for users. This will include the ability to enable or disable the two-step verification on the web/desktop client. “This is very important especially when you lose your phone and you do not remember your PIN. Yes, you can restore it by requesting a reset link, but if you are temporarily unable to log into your mail account, this is a good solution,” WABetaInfo said.

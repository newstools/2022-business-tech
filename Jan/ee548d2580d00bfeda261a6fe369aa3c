The Volvo XC40 P8 Recharge has been spotted on South African roads, marking the local arrival of the Swedish firm’s first all-electric vehicle (EV). Volvo Car South Africa says it has secured an additional allocation of units, with orders now being taken and deliveries expected in June 2022. The XC40 P8 Recharge, priced at R1.2 million, is sold exclusively online via the automaker’s innovative My Volvo website. Greg Maruszewski, managing director at Volvo Car South Africa, said the purchase of the brand’s first pure electric model comes with all manner of additional benefits. “The XC40 P8 Recharge ships standard with the Volvo CARE package, which includes not only a five-year maintenance plan and warranty – with the battery pack covered for eight years or 160,000 km – but also three years of comprehensive insurance, use of a petrol-powered vehicle for a two week holiday every year for three years, a home charging wallbox, and all the requisite charge cables,” said Maruszewski. Volvo said that the electric compact SUV – forming part of the broader Recharge range which made up 27% of the company’s total sales volume in 2021– is able to travel up to 418 km on a single charge, with 80% of its battery capacity replenished in just 40 minutes when using a fast charger. Fitted with twin electric motors and a 78 kWh battery pack, the XC40 P8 Recharge boasts lofty peak outputs of 304 kW and 660 Nm. With power directed to all four wheels, the XC40 P8 Recharge is capable of seeing off the obligatory 0-100 km/h sprint in a mere 4.9 seconds, Volvo said. In true Volvo form, the automaker’s first EV is crammed full of standard safety equipment, including various driver assistance features, and shares its five-star Euro NCAP rating with its combustion-engined siblings.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-553144" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Volvo_XC40-P8-Recharge-1-e1643117610186.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-553142" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Volvo_XC40-P8-Recharge-8-e1643117621792.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-553146" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Volvo_XC40-P8-Recharge-6-e1643117632624.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-553152" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoElectric.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoElectric.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoElectric-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoElectric-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-553154" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoCX-40.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoCX-40.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoCX-40-300x158.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoCX-40-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VolvoCX-40-768x403.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: South Africa’s best-selling SUVs and crossovers right now – including 5 priced under R300,000

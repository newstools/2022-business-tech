Car buying service WeBuyCars says that the Volkswagen Polo is the most sought-after used vehicle brand, citing data collected from a social media report carried out over a six-month period between October 2021 and April 2022. The findings are unsurprising given that the Polo, along with the Polo Vivo, has been among the top-selling passenger vehicle brands in the country for many years. The report, which was conducted via the company’s social media platforms, revealed that the VW Polo topped the list for the most frequently asked for car, while the company’s sales statistics showed that it was also the most sold car for the same period. Toyota, a brand that often tops most popular car lists due to its reliability, dependability, and best resale value, took second place, said WeBuyCars. “Following requests for these marques were queries relating to BMW, Ford and Hyundai which enjoys popularity status for its safety features and durability, among others.” The next top five brands are Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Audi, Chevrolet, and Renault. The most popular makes and models sold were Ford Ranger, Volkswagen Polo, BMW 3 Series, Toyota Hilux and Volkswagen Polo Vivo, said WeBuyCars. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522994" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FordRanger.jpg" alt="" width="951" height="535" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FordRanger.jpg 951w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FordRanger-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FordRanger-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-553560" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2018-volkswagen-polo-e1652781958203.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-288882" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BMW3series-e1647950114651.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-438839" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-521040" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-Polo-Vivo-e1631543055666.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> The most popular body types sold by WeBuyCars were hatchbacks, SUV, sedans, single cabs, double cabs and MPVs, while the vehicle types which received the fewest queries were scooters, recreational cars, chassis cabs, dropsides, dual-purpose vehicles and panel vans. The report also revealed that the vehicle price range most requested for on social media was under R80,000 and that the average selling price was around R135,000. “Demand for used cars is currently at an all-time high, due to a combination of factors ranging from the global shortage of new vehicles, financial constraints and most significantly, the rise in the cost of living exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Consumers are feeling the pinch and are therefore turning to used cars for financial relief and value for money,” said Rikus Blomerus, GM- marketing at WeBuyCars. “As they continue to make this shift, it’s clear from the volume of queries on our platforms that top among their requirements are affordability, reliability, and durability, all key characteristics that help take your money further. These characteristics define the brands that have made the most sought-after list which makes the data revealed by our report come as no surprise.” Blomerus said WeBuyCars continues to see strong demand for a broad selection of vehicles, from both buyers and sellers, across its social media platforms, and on the floors of its 11 warehouses around the country.  It is currently averaging 11,000 vehicles bought each month.

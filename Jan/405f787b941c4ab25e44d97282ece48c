The South African Guild of Mobility Journalists’ Car of the Year (COTY) committee has on Friday announced the semi-finalists for the 2022 SA Car of the Year competition. The competition is the oldest car competition in the country. The 39 semi-finalists represent 10 categories launched between 31 March and 31 December 2021. Four contenders tied with identical scores in the final 35th semi-finalist position and were all included. A total of 65 new vehicles launched in South Africa during this period were considered for this year’s COTY competition. For the first time in the competition’s history, the decision was made that vehicles launched with both regular and new energy derivatives would be entered into both their relevant vehicle category and the New Energy Category. Vehicle ranges that only launched a new energy derivative were also included in the ever-growing New Energy Category. The recently announced 25 juror and trainee juror teams will vote for the 2022 COTY competition finalists in 10 categories. The categories are: Budget, Compact, Compact Family, Midsize, Premium, Luxury, Performance, New Energy, Adventure SUV and 4X4 Double Cab. Toyota dominates with seven semi-finalists competing in five categories, but there is also strong representation by Audi and Hyundai. Surprisingly, the Performance Category has nine contenders, the most in many years. This year there are no contenders in the Budget category, the guild said. Shortly the jurors will narrow the field of semi-finalists to worthy finalists. They are given eight weeks to assess vehicles, after which the final scoring will commence, determining the 2022 SA Car of the Year. “The overall 2020 SA Car of the Year winner remains the most coveted of all automotive competition titles in South Africa and enjoys international recognition,” the guild said.

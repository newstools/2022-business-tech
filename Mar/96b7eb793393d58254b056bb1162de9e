Eskom chief operating officer Jan Oberholzer says that the power utility will continue with stage 2 load shedding for the rest of the week as it continues to bring units back online. In a media briefing on Tuesday morning (8 March), Oberholzer said that stage 2 load shedding will now continue until 05h00 on Saturday. He said that Eskom had to utilise 17 Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs) on Sunday, hampering its ability to replenish energy reserves. Further breakdowns meant the power utility had to once again rely on the OCGTs and introduce load shedding as the total losses on Monday afternoon reached 4,500MW. Additional units are expected to return to service over the coming days, but due to the unpredictability of these units, Eskom has had no choice but to extend the load shedding, he said. Schedules Eskom has warned in a summer load shedding forecast for 2021/2022, that its system is likely to remain severely constrained for the near future.

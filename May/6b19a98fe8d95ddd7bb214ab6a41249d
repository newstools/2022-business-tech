Volkswagen says its new Taigo will join the SUV model range in South Africa from June 2022. Pronounced ‘tie-go’, it will join the T-Cross and T-Roc as Volkswagen’s trio of compact SUVs in the A0 SUV segment. Volkswagen’s T SUV range currently consists of five models namely the T-Cross, T-Roc, Tiguan, Tiguan Allspace and Touareg. The Taigo is available in Life, Style and R-Line versions, and features a 1.0 TSI engine with 85kW of power and 200Nm of torque. The three-cylinder engine is paired with the 7-speed DSG transmission. Fuel consumption is 5.4 litres/100 km and it takes just 11.3 seconds to go from 0 to 100km/h. Retail pricing will be announced closer to the launch date, Volkswagen said. Highlights of the new Taigo include raised seating position and unrestricted suitability for everyday use. The technical basis of the new Taigo is provided by Volkswagen’s Modular Transverse Toolkit (MQB). The MQB platform offers a range of advantages: tight proportions are combined with a high level of body rigidity, excellent crash properties and a low body weight, the German carmaker said. The design of the Taigo is characterised by a strongly forward-sloping C-pillar. The side view is also characterised by very precise and sharp lines. The luggage compartment volume is 440 litres and offers almost as much storage space with full seating as the T-Cross with its sliding rear seat (385 to 455 litres). All exterior lighting elements from the headlights to the rear lights feature LED technology as standard. The Taigo is flatter and longer than the T-Cross and has a ground clearance of 137 mm. The long wheelbase of 2 566 mm gives all passengers a comfortable and slightly elevated seating position, VW said. As compared to the Polo and T-Cross, the distance between the axles has been increased by two and three millimetres respectively. The new Taigo is available in eight exterior colours – two solid paint finishes, five metallic paint finishes and one pearl effect finish. All body colours except Deep Black Pearl can be combined with a contrasting black roof. Customers can choose wheel sizes from 16 to 18-inch alloy wheels. The new model is available with a choice of three different infotainment systems: Composition Colour with a 6.5-inch display (standard in the Life), Composition Media with an 8.0-inch display (standard in Style and R-Line) and the optional Discover Media with an 8.0-inch display format. The 2-zone climatronic air conditioning (standard in the Style and R-Line) has a new, digitalised mode of operation: touch panels and sliders now perform the functions of rotary knobs and buttons. The vehicle is equipped with the optional Lane Assist, the lane-keeping system, while the Driver Alert System, which comes as standard, detects if the driver has lost concentration and sends them an acoustic warning lasting five seconds. In addition, a break recommendation is displayed in the instrument cluster. If the driver does not take a break within the next 15 minutes, the warning is repeated. “Park Assist automatically guides the Taigo into perpendicular or parallel parking spaces and can reverse the car out of the latter as well. The system is activated by pressing a button on the centre console,” VW said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586234" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Volkswagen-Taigo_001-scaled-e1652430974692.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586232" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Volkswagen-Taigo_002-scaled-e1652430984842.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586230" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Volkswagen-Taigo_003-scaled-e1652430992886.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586228" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Volkswagen-Taigo_004-scaled-e1652431004383.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> Read: New VW Polo derivatives on sale in South Africa at the end of the month – here’s how much they cost

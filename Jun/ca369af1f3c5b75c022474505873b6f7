The South Africa National Roads Agency (Sanral) has announced emergency pavement repairs on the N3, which will result in a reduction in the number of lanes. The roads agency said that the work to be done includes the patching of the slow lane and will be undertaken over several consecutive weekends from 9 July to 19 September 2022. Each weekend closure will start at 14h00 on Saturday afternoon and run until 04h00 on Monday morning. The upgrades are set to take place between Ashburton and New England Road. “The emergency pavement repairs are due to the deterioration of the road pavement under traffic loading and the delay in the commencement of the upgrade contract over this section,” said Jason Lowe, Sanral’s Eastern Region Project Manager. “The existing surfacing will be removed and replaced at periods when traffic flows are at their lowest in an attempt to minimise the effect on the travelling public,” said Lowe. <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-600632" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Road-work-ahead.png" alt="" width="970" height="573" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Road-work-ahead.png 1308w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Road-work-ahead-300x177.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Road-work-ahead-1024x605.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Road-work-ahead-768x454.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Road-work-ahead-1200x709.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The closures and impact on lanes are anticipated as follows: 9 July to 19 September – N3 northbound and southbound between Ashburton and New England Road:

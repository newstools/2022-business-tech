Smart homes are no longer a thing of the future, but a reality of the present – and soon they will be even smarter. Click here to view CBI-electric’s range of smart home products. Global spending on IoT (Internet of Things) products is forecast to reach $1.1 trillion in 2023, and unlike other industries, the meteoric growth of IoT has been unaffected by the pandemic. Because of this, artificial intelligence (AI) has also increasingly become entrenched in our daily lives, which in turn is making it more intelligent. This is because it is using information gathered from the grid, weather data, and smart meters, along with energy consumption stats, to analyse, improve and optimise our homes’ operational and energy performance. The exponential advancement of this technology means that in the future, not only will smart homes anticipate our needs automatically, but they will also be able to detect health conditions, prepare our meals, and even exercise our pets for us. Additionally, all appliances, plugs and accessories will have an element of automation based on our needs or schedules, and the smart homes of tomorrow will be incredibly connected, conscious and autonomous. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-347391" src="https://test.businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Body-CBI.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /> Today’s homes have been elevated by a myriad of devices ranging from those for home intelligence, and energy efficiency, to entertainment, access control and home comfort. But now, with more people working remotely, this has expanded to include devices that aid with daily tasks and connectivity. As technology advances, the more these devices will talk to each other. In doing so, smart homes will be able to learn more about their owners or occupants and be able to anticipate their needs. This is the result of the data that these interconnected devices will be able to collect, analyse, share and execute on, helping to transform houses of the future from a number of interconnected gadgets and accessories into truly “smart” homes. Imagine, for example, coming home to a package of medicine delivered by drone courtesy of the health sensors embedded in your bathroom which detected signs of an impending illness and automatically placed an order with your pharmacy via a health app. South Africa’s energy crisis could potentially dictate how locals transform their homes. Last year, load shedding hit record levels, with 1,136 hours of planned power cuts – the highest in the country’s history. Households consume approximately 25% of all energy generated by Eskom. In future, however, homes (and neighbourhoods) could be powered by smart microgrids which use renewable energy sources. This helps to reduce reliance and the pressure on the national grid, while also providing a stable energy supply. These systems could also be profitable as energy could be sold back to municipalities or Eskom. In Alabama, a microgrid pilot project was launched to test how homes can interact and become more energy efficient. The 62 homes in the Alabama Smart Neighbourhood have been built to incorporate home automation and be connected to a microgrid.

Different objectives can also be set such as minimising costs or reducing carbon output. Additionally, the control system communicates with devices in the homes and can adjust these remotely. However, each home within the microgrid can set parameters within which this software can make changes, such as maximum and minimum temperatures for heating and cooling. South Africa is still developing concepts and ideas around microgrids and smart city developments. However, with the pressure on the national grid and the ailing generation infrastructure, it is essential that small cell systems, including smart buildings become common place. These will help to support and maintain the national grid and also ensure that all users have access to a reliable energy supply. Seventy-three percent of homeowners say they use smart devices for convenience and time saving. While today’s technology enables users to control home appliances and systems from anywhere in the world, the capabilities will be amplified for further convenience going forward. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-347393" src="https://test.businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMAGE-1-V1-landscape.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /> We are already seeing the emergence of fridges that email owners recipes based on what’s inside, washing machines that send a text message once a load of laundry finishes and virtual assistants that respond to one’s mood based on tone of voice. We also have irrigation systems that only turn on when scheduled if it is not raining. Most of these smart home devices are controlled via apps, so getting them all to be managed seamlessly via a single command centre could offer users the greatest convenience. Smart homes will be the future. Life as we know it will be irrevocably altered for the better of consumers and the country at large.

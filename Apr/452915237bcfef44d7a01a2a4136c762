Running a business comes with a seemingly never-ending checklist. While your days are filled with budgeting, marketing, invoicing, tracking, and keeping your customers and employees smiling, it can be tempting to move Public Liability Insurance to the bottom of your priorities. But Public Liability Insurance could be considered one of the most important types of business cover. Here are 3 reasons why it could be essential for your business: Public Liability Insurance protects your business against claims made by the general public for costs resulting from property damage, injuries and death which you are legally liable for. And the general public doesn’t just include clients or customers. Claims can be made by just about anyone who interacts with your business, whether it’s on-site at your business, at a client’s premises, or even at a customer’s home. This makes every business a public business, whether you specialise in hospitality, trade, health, retail, real estate, transportation, or entertainment. Even if you run your business online, you’d still benefit from Public Liability Insurance seeing as your employees may interact with the public when picking up supplies and delivering them to your customers. You may have put excellent systems in place to run your business as responsibly as possible. But no matter how well you’ve safeguarded your business against risks, you can’t control every interaction with the public. Even if you put up warning signs when your business’ floor is wet, a client could slip and fall. This could lead to medical costs or even a lawsuit. Likewise, even your most conscientious employee could accidentally break your customer’s television while moving furniture for them, leading to pricy repair costs. By getting Public Liability Insurance, you ensure that you don’t have to pay out-of-pocket for unpredictable incidents like these. This could seriously protect your business’ bottom-line, especially in the wake of a costly lawsuit. Protecting your business doesn’t have to be expensive.

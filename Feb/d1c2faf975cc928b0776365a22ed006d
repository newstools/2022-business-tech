Telecommunications Group MTN has revealed a new logo ahead of an official brand refresh. The logo, which has been submitted to the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission for approval, will see the traditional yellow, blue and white logo replaced with a sleek black design. In an accompanying press release, MTN said it will make an official announcement at the end of February. “MTN Group’s Ambition 2025, aimed at ‘Leading digital platforms for Africa’s progress’ has ushered in a new look that is aligned to our evolution from a telecommunications company to a technology company underpinned by one simple, consistent, yet striking brand. “Our commitment and focus to accelerate Africa’s progress sees MTN revealing a refreshed brand identity and campaign from 27 February. The campaign is inspired by an insight that doing is a bridge between can and done, because all progress comes from action.” MTN chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer Nompilo Morafo said the new look aligns with their evolution from a telecommunications company to a technology company. “Our commitment and focus to accelerate Africa’s progress sees MTN revealing a refreshed brand identity and campaign from 27 February,” said Morafo. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-559440" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-new-logo1.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-new-logo1.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-new-logo1-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MTN CIPC application <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Read: Government promises to give every South African 10GB of free data a month
